Project: The Golden Thread Quest
Purpose: Diagrams for docs/USER-GUIDE.md
Style: Professional expedition field guide. Deep ink navy (#172433) and warm parchment
  (#f7f4ec) foundation, restrained amber-gold (#c8962f) used only for verified achievement
  and progress, muted region accents. Clean geometric shapes, generous whitespace, precise
  thin strokes. Flat vector illustration with subtle paper texture. No gradients on text,
  no drop shadows, no 3D, no photorealism, no cartoon characters, no gamified trophies or
  confetti. It should look at home in an enterprise training program, not a mobile game.
Generator: gemini-3-pro-image-preview

# Image Plan — User Guide

Five diagrams for `docs/USER-GUIDE.md`. Each one carries an idea the prose states but that a
reader skimming will miss, and each is placed where a reader would otherwise have to hold
three things in their head at once.

Entries are numbered in the order a reader meets them.

**Every image must teach something the sentence beside it does not.** An image that restates
its caption is decoration and does not belong here, however good it looks.

**Deliberately not planned:** screenshots of the application. Those go stale the moment a
template changes, and the guide already describes the screens in words. These five are
conceptual, so they stay true across releases.

**Text in images is rationed.** Generated text degrades badly past a handful of short labels,
and a mangled word in a diagram costs more credibility than a missing one. Each entry below
caps its own word count, and anything essential is in the prose beside the image. None of
these images is the only source of any information in the guide.

**Paths.** Images land in `docs/media/images/` because `docs/USER-GUIDE.md` references them
relatively. A repository-root `media/` directory would leave every image on the page broken.

### Image 1: 01-first-hour-flow

- **File**: docs/media/images/01-first-hour-flow.png
- **Page**: User guide, Section 3 — Your first hour
- **Alt text**: "Your first hour splits in two: the application handles starting the quest,
  recording validation and submitting, while you do the actual work in your own repository and
  commit and push it yourself. The application never touches your Git history."
- **Description**: A horizontal band divided into two lanes that share one continuous path.
  The upper lane is labeled "in the app" and holds four small filled ink-navy markers; the
  lower lane is labeled "in your terminal" and holds three outlined ink-navy markers. The
  single path weaves between the two lanes, crossing the divider each time authority changes
  hands, so the eye follows one route rather than reading two rows. The final marker sits in
  the lower lane after a visible gap, alone, in amber-gold outline — it is the participant's
  own act of committing and pushing, and nothing in the upper lane reaches it. Short lowercase
  labels sit beside markers, not beneath, to keep the composition wide and calm.
- **Prompt**:
  Goal: Make clear which steps the application performs and which the participant performs
    themselves, especially that committing and pushing is theirs alone and the application
    never does it.
  Scene: Two horizontal lanes labeled "in the app" and "in your terminal", with one
    continuous thin path weaving between them and crossing the divider whenever authority
    changes; filled markers in the upper lane, outlined markers in the lower; a visible gap
    before a final solitary amber-gold outlined marker in the lower lane.
  Style: Flat vector field-guide illustration, thin precise strokes, subtle paper texture,
    muted palette, generous whitespace, no shadows, no gradients.
  Aspect ratio: 3:2
  Background: warm parchment #f7f4ec
  Text in image: two lane labels "in the app" and "in your terminal", and seven short
    lowercase marker labels — start quest, do the work, write proof, run checks, record
    result, submit, commit and push. No other text.
  Avoid: swimlane business diagrams, UML, numbered step badges, screenshots, browser chrome,
    cursors, arrows with heavy heads, any sentence-length text, human figures

---

### Image 2: 02-state-authority

- **File**: docs/media/images/02-state-authority.png
- **Page**: User guide, Section 4 — The eight states
- **Alt text**: "Eight quest states in three columns by who sets them: the application sets
  locked and available; you set in progress, evidence ready, locally validated and submitted;
  only a reviewer sets needs changes and verified."
- **Description**: Eight state chips arranged in three labeled columns by authority: the
  application, you, the reviewer. Each chip is a rounded pill carrying its state name, in the
  muted color that state uses in the real interface — slate for locked and available, violet
  for in progress, blue for evidence ready and submitted, green for locally validated, orange
  for needs changes, amber-gold for verified. A thin vertical rule separates the reviewer
  column from the other two, and the gap at that rule is wider than the gap between the first
  two columns, so the boundary reads as a threshold rather than a divider. The verified chip
  is the only solid amber element in the image; every other chip is outlined.
- **Prompt**:
  Goal: Show at a glance that verified completion is the reviewer's alone, and that the
    participant cannot reach it however much work they do.
  Scene: Eight rounded state chips in three labeled authority columns; a thin vertical rule
    before the reviewer column with noticeably wider spacing at that rule; every chip outlined
    except the verified chip, which is solid amber-gold.
  Style: Flat vector, rounded pills, muted status colors, thin rules, generous whitespace,
    no shadows, no gradients.
  Aspect ratio: 3:2
  Background: warm parchment #f7f4ec
  Text in image: three column headings "application", "you", "reviewer", and eight chip
    labels — locked, available, in progress, evidence ready, locally validated, submitted,
    needs changes, verified. No caption, no other text.
  Avoid: padlock cliches, red and green as the only distinction, traffic lights, arrows
    between chips, flowchart connectors, gradients, any sentence-length text

### Image 3: 03-ownership-zones

- **File**: docs/media/images/03-ownership-zones.png
- **Page**: User guide, Section 6 — What the application writes
- **Alt text**: "Three ownership zones side by side: program-owned content and application
  code, your own work and evidence, and machine-owned generated output that is disposable.
  Only the middle zone is yours, and nothing the application does replaces it."
- **Description**: Three adjacent rectangular regions in a single row, drawn as areas on a
  field map rather than boxes in a diagram, separated by narrow parchment gutters and never
  overlapping or nested. Left: program-owned, flat ink-navy fill with a solid border.
  Center: participant-owned, warm parchment fill with an amber-gold border, drawn noticeably
  taller and wider than its neighbors so it anchors the composition. Right: machine-owned,
  pale gray fill with a dashed border to suggest impermanence. Small folder glyphs sit inside
  each region with short labels. A compact two-line key in the lower right corner marks which
  zones are in Git, using a filled dot and a hollow dot rather than words repeated per region.
- **Prompt**:
  Goal: Make it immediately obvious which files belong to the participant, and that the
    machine-owned zone is disposable and safe to delete.
  Scene: Three adjacent map regions in one row, not nested and not overlapping — left solid
    ink-navy with a solid border, center warm parchment with an amber-gold border and visibly
    larger than both neighbors, right pale gray with a dashed border — each holding two or
    three small folder glyphs, plus a compact key in the lower right using a filled dot and a
    hollow dot.
  Style: Flat vector field-guide map, thin precise borders, dashed border on the disposable
    zone only, muted palette, generous whitespace, no shadows.
  Aspect ratio: 3:2
  Background: warm parchment #f7f4ec
  Text in image: three zone names "program", "yours", "machine"; six short folder labels —
    content, quest app, participant, evidence, generated, local data; key words "in git" and
    "not in git". No other text.
  Avoid: cloud icons, server racks, padlocks, database cylinders, 3D isometric views, nested
    or overlapping regions, any sentence-length text

---

### Image 4: 04-evidence-package

- **File**: docs/media/images/04-evidence-package.png
- **Page**: User guide, Section 7 — Evidence that holds up
- **Alt text**: "Forms of evidence, strongest first: a repository artifact, then reproducible
  instructions, then automated execution evidence, then a demonstration. Above them all and
  separated from them sits reviewer approval, which evidence earns but never becomes."
- **Description**: A vertical stack read top to bottom in the same order the guide numbers it.
  Four bands of evidence sit together: a repository artifact at the top as the widest and
  most solid ink-navy band, then reproducible instructions, then execution evidence, then a
  demonstration at the bottom as the narrowest and palest, its border dashed to mark it as the
  weakest form on its own. Above the four, separated by a clear empty gap that no connector or
  arrow crosses, sits a single amber-gold band for reviewer approval — the participant builds
  the four, and cannot build the fifth. A slim vertical scale runs up the left edge, labeled
  only at its ends. The stack sits left of center with open parchment to the right, so it
  reads as a field-guide plate rather than a marketing pyramid.
- **Prompt**:
  Goal: Show that evidence has a strength order with a repository artifact strongest and a
    demonstration weakest, and that reviewer approval sits above the whole scale and is
    reached only by the reviewer.
  Scene: Four stacked horizontal bands, widest and most solid at the top narrowing and paling
    downward, the bottom band with a dashed border; above them a clear empty gap with nothing
    crossing it; above that gap a single solid amber-gold band; a slim vertical scale at the
    left edge labeled only at its two ends; the stack positioned left of center.
  Style: Flat vector, flat fills, thin precise strokes, muted palette, generous whitespace,
    subtle paper texture, no shadows, no gradients.
  Aspect ratio: 3:2
  Background: warm parchment #f7f4ec
  Text in image: five band labels — reviewer approval, an artifact, instructions to reproduce,
    execution evidence, a demonstration; and two scale end words "stronger" at the top and
    "weaker" at the bottom. No other text.
  Avoid: classic marketing funnel shapes, Maslow pyramid styling, arrows climbing the stack,
    numbered tiers, trophies, checkmark clipart, any sentence-length text

---

### Image 5: 05-passport-outcome

- **File**: docs/media/images/05-passport-outcome.png
- **Page**: User guide, Section 11 — Knowing when you are finished
- **Alt text**: "The passport shows claimed and verified progress as two separate totals that
  are never added together: a set of region marks, some outlined for claimed and some filled
  amber for verified, with the two counts kept deliberately apart."
- **Description**: A single flat passport page, centered, with a restrained ruled header. Its
  body is one row of eight small square region marks: five outlined in ink-navy for claimed,
  three filled solid amber-gold for verified, so the difference is visible without reading a
  legend. Beneath the row sit two separate totals, set well apart with clear parchment between
  them and no bar, no arrow and no plus sign joining them — one labeled claimed, one labeled
  verified. The composition holds nothing else: no document stack, no reviewer column, no
  secondary panel. It should read as a surveyor's record, formal and slightly sparse, and the
  emptiness between the two totals is the point of the image.
- **Prompt**:
  Goal: Show that claimed progress and verified progress are two separate figures that the
    application never combines, and that only verified marks are gold.
  Scene: One flat passport page with a thin ruled header, a single row of eight small square
    region marks — five outlined ink-navy, three solid amber-gold — and two clearly separated
    totals below with open parchment between them and nothing joining them.
  Style: Flat vector, restrained and formal, thin rules, generous whitespace, subtle paper
    texture, amber-gold used only for verified marks, no shadows.
  Aspect ratio: 3:2
  Background: warm parchment #f7f4ec
  Text in image: the word "passport" in the header, and two labels "claimed" and "verified".
    No region names, no numbers, no other text.
  Avoid: trophies, medals, stars, ribbons, rosettes, a single progress bar merging the two
    values, percentage rings, confetti, celebration imagery, document stacks, any
    sentence-length text

---

## Round 2 — corrections

Round 1 generated all five. `04-evidence-package` is correct and final. The other three each rendered clean text but got the content wrong, so each gets a v2
entry rather than an edit. The v1 files stay on disk for comparison.

What went wrong, and the lesson for later entries: a prompt that describes a *pattern*
("filled markers in the upper lane") lets the generator choose which item goes where. Every
v2 entry below assigns each item to its position by name, leaving nothing to infer.

### Image 6: 01-first-hour-flow-v2

- **File**: docs/media/images/01-first-hour-flow-v2.png
- **Page**: User guide, Section 3 — Your first hour
- **Fixes**: v1 placed "run checks" and "submit" in the terminal lane. Both happen in the
  application (guide steps 6 and 7). Lane membership is now stated per marker.
- **Alt text**: "Your first hour splits in two: the application handles starting the quest,
  running checks, recording the result and submitting, while you do the work in your own
  repository, write PROOF.md, and commit and push it yourself."
- **Description**: A horizontal band divided into two lanes by a thin rule. The upper lane is
  labeled "in the app" and the lower lane "in your terminal". One continuous thin path runs
  left to right, crossing the divider exactly three times, visiting seven markers in this
  fixed order and no other: start quest in the upper lane, do the work in the lower lane,
  write proof in the lower lane, run checks in the upper lane, record result in the upper
  lane, submit in the upper lane, and finally commit and push in the lower lane. Markers in
  the upper lane are solid filled ink-navy; markers in the lower lane are outlined ink-navy.
  The last marker, commit and push, sits after a clear horizontal gap that the path does not
  cross, and it alone is amber-gold — it is the participant's own act, and the path from the
  application never reaches it.
- **Prompt**:
  Goal: Make clear which steps the application performs and which the participant performs
    themselves, especially that committing and pushing is theirs alone.
  Scene: Two horizontal lanes separated by a thin rule, upper labeled "in the app", lower
    labeled "in your terminal". Seven markers in this exact placement, left to right —
    marker 1 "start quest" in the UPPER lane, marker 2 "do the work" in the LOWER lane,
    marker 3 "write proof" in the LOWER lane, marker 4 "run checks" in the UPPER lane,
    marker 5 "record result" in the UPPER lane, marker 6 "submit" in the UPPER lane, marker 7
    "commit and push" in the LOWER lane. Upper-lane markers are solid filled; lower-lane
    markers are outlined. A single continuous thin path connects markers 1 through 6 only,
    crossing between lanes where the lane changes. After marker 6 there is a clear empty gap
    that no path crosses, and marker 7 stands alone beyond it in amber-gold.
  Style: Flat vector field-guide illustration, thin precise strokes, subtle paper texture,
    muted palette, generous whitespace, no shadows, no gradients.
  Aspect ratio: 3:2
  Background: warm parchment #f7f4ec
  Text in image: two lane labels "in the app" and "in your terminal", and seven marker labels
    — start quest, do the work, write proof, run checks, record result, submit, commit and
    push. No other text, no numbers.
  Avoid: swimlane business diagrams, UML, numbered step badges, screenshots, browser chrome,
    cursors, arrows with heavy heads, a path that continues into the final marker, any
    sentence-length text, human figures

### Image 7: 02-state-authority-v2

- **File**: docs/media/images/02-state-authority-v2.png
- **Page**: User guide, Section 4 — The eight states
- **Fixes**: v1 put "locally validated" in the reviewer column. It is a participant state, and
  its presence there contradicted the one thing the image exists to say. Column membership is
  now stated exhaustively, and the reviewer column is explicitly limited to two chips.
- **Alt text**: "Eight quest states in three columns by who sets them: the application sets
  locked and available; you set in progress, evidence ready, locally validated and submitted;
  only a reviewer sets needs changes and verified."
- **Description**: Three labeled columns of rounded state chips. The first column is headed
  "application" and contains exactly two chips: locked, available. The second is headed "you"
  and contains exactly four chips: in progress, evidence ready, locally validated, submitted.
  The third is headed "reviewer" and contains exactly two chips and no others: needs changes,
  verified. Column headings are plain text above each column, not chips. One single thin
  vertical rule sits between the second and third columns and nowhere else, with wider
  spacing at that rule than between the first two columns. Every chip is outlined in its
  muted status color except verified, which is solid amber-gold with light text.
- **Prompt**:
  Goal: Show at a glance that verified completion is the reviewer's alone, and that the
    participant cannot reach it however much work they do.
  Scene: Three columns of rounded pill chips under plain text headings. Column 1 heading
    "application" with exactly these two chips: locked, available. Column 2 heading "you"
    with exactly these four chips: in progress, evidence ready, locally validated, submitted.
    Column 3 heading "reviewer" with exactly these two chips and nothing else: needs changes,
    verified. Exactly one thin vertical rule, placed between column 2 and column 3, with a
    wider gap there than between columns 1 and 2. All chips outlined except verified, which
    is solid amber-gold.
  Style: Flat vector, rounded pills, muted status colors, thin rules, generous whitespace,
    no shadows, no gradients.
  Aspect ratio: 3:2
  Background: warm parchment #f7f4ec
  Text in image: three plain headings "application", "you", "reviewer", and the eight chip
    labels exactly as assigned above. No caption, no numbers, no other text.
  Avoid: headings drawn as pills or boxes, more than one vertical rule, any chip in a column
    other than the one assigned, padlock cliches, traffic lights, arrows or connectors
    between chips, gradients, any sentence-length text

### Image 8: 05-passport-outcome-v2

- **File**: docs/media/images/05-passport-outcome-v2.png
- **Page**: User guide, Section 11 — Knowing when you are finished
- **Fixes**: v1 invented the figures 10601 and 10602, showing verified higher than claimed.
  Verified is always a subset of claimed, so the image asserted something the application
  cannot produce. The two figures are now fixed values that agree with the marks drawn, and
  v1's large empty center is filled by enlarging the mark row.
- **Alt text**: "The passport shows claimed and verified progress as two separate totals that
  are never added together: eight region marks, five outlined for claimed and three filled
  amber for verified, with claimed at eight and verified at three kept deliberately apart."
- **Description**: A single flat passport page, centered, with a thin ruled header carrying the
  word passport. Its body is one row of eight square region marks, sized large enough to fill
  the page width comfortably: the first five outlined in ink-navy, the last three solid
  amber-gold. Beneath the row sit two separate boxed totals, set far apart with open parchment
  between them and nothing joining them — the left reads claimed 8, the right reads verified
  3. The figures agree with the marks above: eight marks in total, three of them gold. Nothing
  else appears on the page.
- **Prompt**:
  Goal: Show that claimed progress and verified progress are two separate figures the
    application never combines, that verified is always the smaller, and that only verified
    marks are gold.
  Scene: One flat passport page with a thin ruled header reading "passport". Below it, a
    single row of eight large square marks — the first five outlined ink-navy, the last three
    solid amber-gold. Below that, two separated boxed totals with wide open parchment between
    them and no line, bar or arrow joining them: the left box reads "claimed 8" and the right
    box reads "verified 3".
  Style: Flat vector, restrained and formal, thin rules, generous whitespace, subtle paper
    texture, amber-gold used only for verified marks, no shadows, no gradients.
  Aspect ratio: 3:2
  Background: warm parchment #f7f4ec
  Text in image: exactly four pieces of text — "passport", "claimed 8", "verified 3". No
    region names, no other numerals, no other text.
  Avoid: any number other than 8 and 3, a verified figure larger than the claimed figure,
    trophies, medals, stars, ribbons, a single progress bar merging the two values,
    percentage rings, confetti, document stacks, large empty areas, any sentence-length text

---

### Image 9: 03-ownership-zones-v2

- **File**: docs/media/images/03-ownership-zones-v2.png
- **Fixes**: v1 labeled the left zone "programme". In British English that word most often
  means a television or radio broadcast, and it is not the project's term either — the
  codebase and `CLAUDE.md` say "program-owned" throughout, 42 uses against zero. The label is
  now "program".
- **Page**: User guide, Section 6 — What the application writes
- **Alt text**: "Three ownership zones side by side: program-owned content and application
  code, your own work and evidence, and machine-owned generated output that is disposable.
  Only the middle zone is yours, and nothing the application does replaces it."
- **Description**: Identical in every respect to v1, which was otherwise correct, with the
  single change that the left zone is labeled "program" rather than "programme". Three
  adjacent rectangular regions in a single row, drawn as areas on a field map rather than
  boxes in a diagram, separated by narrow parchment gutters and never overlapping or nested.
  Left: program-owned, flat ink-navy fill with a solid border, holding folder glyphs for
  content and quest app. Center: participant-owned, warm parchment fill with an amber-gold
  border, drawn noticeably taller and wider than its neighbors so it anchors the composition,
  holding folder glyphs for participant and evidence. Right: machine-owned, pale gray fill
  with a dashed border to suggest impermanence, holding folder glyphs for generated and local
  data. A compact two-line key in the lower right corner marks which zones are in Git, using a
  filled dot and a hollow dot.
- **Prompt**:
  Goal: Make it immediately obvious which files belong to the participant, and that the
    machine-owned zone is disposable and safe to delete.
  Scene: Three adjacent map regions in one row, not nested and not overlapping — left solid
    ink-navy with a solid border, center warm parchment with an amber-gold border and visibly
    larger than both neighbors, right pale gray with a dashed border — each holding two small
    folder glyphs, plus a compact key in the lower right using a filled dot and a hollow dot.
  Style: Flat vector field-guide map, thin precise borders, dashed border on the disposable
    zone only, muted palette, generous whitespace, no shadows.
  Aspect ratio: 3:2
  Background: warm parchment #f7f4ec
  Text in image: three zone names "program", "yours", "machine"; six short folder labels —
    content, quest app, participant, evidence, generated, local data; key words "in git" and
    "not in git". No other text.
  Avoid: the word "programme" in any form, cloud icons, server racks, padlocks, database
    cylinders, 3D isometric views, nested or overlapping regions, any sentence-length text

---

### Image 10: 03-ownership-zones-v3

- **File**: docs/media/images/03-ownership-zones-v3.png
- **Fixes**: v2 labeled the left zone "system". The instruction "avoid the word programme in
  any form" pushed the model away from the whole word family rather than toward the one word
  wanted, so it substituted a synonym. The word is now stated positively and spelled out, and
  the negative instruction is gone. v2 also drew the folder glyphs as filled color blocks and
  lost the left zone's solid fill; both are restored to v1, which was right about everything
  except the one word.
- **Page**: User guide, Section 6 — What the application writes
- **Alt text**: "Three ownership zones side by side: program-owned content and application
  code, your own work and evidence, and machine-owned generated output that is disposable.
  Only the middle zone is yours, and nothing the application does replaces it."
- **Description**: Three adjacent rectangular regions in a single row on a field map, not
  nested and not overlapping. The left region is filled solid deep ink-navy with light text
  and is headed with the single word "program". The centre region is warm parchment with an
  amber-gold border, drawn noticeably taller and wider than both neighbours so it anchors the
  composition, headed "yours". The right region is pale grey with a dashed border, headed
  "machine". Each region holds two small outlined folder glyphs with short lowercase labels
  beside them, and a small filled or hollow dot after each label showing whether it is in Git.
  A compact two-line key sits in the lower right.
- **Prompt**:
  Goal: Make it immediately obvious which files belong to the participant, and that the
    machine-owned zone is disposable and safe to delete.
  Scene: Three adjacent map regions in one row, not nested and not overlapping. LEFT region:
    filled solid deep ink-navy, light text, heading is exactly the seven-letter English word
    "program" (p-r-o-g-r-a-m), holding two small outlined folder glyphs labeled content and
    quest app. CENTRE region: warm parchment fill with an amber-gold border, visibly taller
    and wider than both neighbours, heading "yours", holding two small outlined folder glyphs
    labeled participant and evidence. RIGHT region: pale grey fill with a dashed border,
    heading "machine", holding two small outlined folder glyphs labeled generated and local
    data. A small filled dot follows each label in the left and centre regions; a small hollow
    dot follows each label in the right region. A compact two-line key in the lower right
    corner reads "in git" with a filled dot and "not in git" with a hollow dot.
  Style: Flat vector field-guide map, thin precise borders, dashed border on the disposable
    zone only, muted palette, generous whitespace, no shadows, no gradients. Folder glyphs are
    thin outlines, never filled color blocks.
  Aspect ratio: 3:2

### Image 14: 01-first-hour-flow-v3

- **File**: docs/media/images/01-first-hour-flow-v3.png
- **Fixes**: v1 put two steps in the wrong lane. v2 was never generated because its lanes were
  "in the app" against "in your terminal", and that division stopped being true: every action
  is now a `quest-app action` command, and participants on Cowork have no terminal. The lanes
  are now what the application does against what only the participant can do, which is true on
  every surface and is the thing the section is actually about.
- **Page**: User guide, Section 3 — Your first hour
- **Alt text**: "The first hour splits by authority, not by tool: the application starts the
  quest, runs checks, records the result and accepts the submission, while only you can do the
  work, write the proof and commit and push. Nothing in either lane reaches verified."
- **Description**: Two horizontal lanes sharing one continuous path. The upper lane is labeled
  "the application does" and holds four solid ink-navy markers: start quest, run checks, record
  result, submit. The lower lane is labeled "only you can" and holds three outlined markers: do
  the work, write proof, commit and push. The path weaves between the lanes as authority
  changes hands, and the final marker, commit and push, sits alone in the lower lane after a
  gap the path does not cross. At the right edge, separated by a thin vertical rule and touched
  by nothing, a single amber-gold marker labeled verified sits in neither lane.
- **Prompt**:
  Goal: Show that the first hour divides by who has the authority to act, not by which tool is
    open, and that verified sits outside both lanes entirely.
  Scene: Two horizontal lanes separated by a thin rule. Upper lane labeled "the application
    does" with four solid filled ink-navy circular markers in this order: start quest, run
    checks, record result, submit. Lower lane labeled "only you can" with three outlined
    ink-navy markers: do the work, write proof, commit and push. One continuous thin path
    connects them in reading order, crossing between lanes wherever the lane changes, and it
    stops before the final marker: "commit and push" stands alone in the lower lane after a
    clear empty gap that no line crosses. At the far right, past a thin vertical rule, one
    solid amber-gold marker labeled "verified" sits vertically centred between the two lanes,
    with nothing connecting it to anything.
  Style: Flat vector field-guide illustration, thin precise strokes, subtle paper texture,
    muted palette, generous whitespace, no shadows, no gradients.
  Aspect ratio: 3:2
  Background: warm parchment #f7f4ec
  Text in image: two lane labels "the application does" and "only you can"; seven marker
    labels — start quest, run checks, record result, submit, do the work, write proof, commit
    and push; and one label "verified". No other text, no numbers.
  Avoid: swimlane business diagrams, UML, numbered step badges, browser chrome, terminal
    windows, screenshots, any line or arrow touching the verified marker, arrows with heavy
    heads, any sentence-length text, human figures

### Image 15: 03-ownership-zones-v4

- **File**: docs/media/images/03-ownership-zones-v4.png
- **Fixes**: neither earlier take is shippable. v1 is right in every respect except that it
  labels the left zone "programme". v3 fixes the word and loses the spacing between each
  folder label and the small Git dot that follows it, so "content ●" renders as "content."
  and "generated ○" as "generatedo" — a legend a reader misreads as punctuation. Rounds 2
  and 3 both failed on the same thing: a tiny glyph set immediately after a word is the one
  element this model will not keep apart from the word. v4 stops asking for it. Git
  membership moves out of the labels and onto the zone, as one small chip in each zone's
  upper-right corner, which is also truer to the model — membership is a property of the
  zone, not of the individual folder.
- **Page**: User guide, Section 6 — What the application writes
- **Alt text**: "Three ownership zones side by side: program-owned content and application
  code, your own work and evidence, and machine-owned generated output that is disposable.
  Only the middle zone is yours, and nothing the application does replaces it."
- **Description**: Three adjacent rectangular regions in a single row on a field map, not
  nested and not overlapping. The left region is filled solid deep ink-navy with light text
  and is headed with the single word "program". The centre region is warm parchment with an
  amber-gold border, drawn noticeably taller and wider than both neighbours so it anchors the
  composition, headed "yours". The right region is pale grey with a dashed border, headed
  "machine". Each region holds two small outlined folder glyphs with short lowercase labels
  beside them. Each region carries one small rounded chip in its upper-right corner reading
  "in git" or "not in git". No dots, anywhere.
- **Prompt**:
  Goal: Make it immediately obvious which files belong to the participant, and that the
    machine-owned zone is disposable and safe to delete.
  Scene: Three adjacent map regions in one row, not nested and not overlapping. LEFT region:
    filled solid deep ink-navy, light text, heading is exactly the seven-letter English word
    "program" (p-r-o-g-r-a-m), holding two small outlined folder glyphs labeled content and
    quest app. CENTRE region: warm parchment fill with an amber-gold border, visibly taller
    and wider than both neighbours, heading "yours", holding two small outlined folder glyphs
    labeled participant and evidence. RIGHT region: pale grey fill with a dashed border,
    heading "machine", holding two small outlined folder glyphs labeled generated and local
    data. Each region carries exactly one small rounded rectangular chip in its upper-right
    corner, clear of every other element: the left and centre chips read "in git", the right
    chip reads "not in git". Every folder label is a plain word with nothing following it and
    clear space to its right.
  Style: Flat vector field-guide map, thin precise borders, dashed border on the disposable
    zone only, muted palette, generous whitespace, no shadows, no gradients. Folder glyphs are
    thin outlines, never filled color blocks. Chips are outlined, not filled, and never gold.
  Aspect ratio: 3:2
  Background: warm parchment #f7f4ec
  Text in image: three headings "program", "yours", "machine"; six folder labels — content,
    quest app, participant, evidence, generated, local data; three chip labels — "in git",
    "in git", "not in git". No other text.
  Avoid: the spelling "programme"; any dot, bullet, circle or small mark placed after a
    label; a separate legend or key anywhere in the frame; nesting one region inside another;
    arrows between regions; folder glyphs filled with solid color; gold used on anything but
    the centre region's border

## Brand marks

Not diagrams. These are the application's own identity, so they follow the house palette but
not the parchment background: an icon has to hold its shape against whatever tab, sidebar or
dock it lands in, and a dark tile does that where parchment does not.

The rule that governs both: **gold means verified, and nothing else does.** The product
rations amber to that single meaning across the state chips, the passport marks and the XP
totals. A brand mark introducing a second accent for approval would contradict the product
before a participant opened it. Two colors, no third.

### Image 16: 05-passport-outcome-v3

- **File**: docs/media/images/05-passport-outcome-v3.png
- **Page**: User guide, Section 11 — Knowing when you are finished
- **Fixes**: v2 draws eight region marks, and the application has had nine regions since
  0.3.0 (the ninth is Trap Cards). The idea the image carries is unchanged, so this is a
  correction of the count only: nine marks, six outlined for claimed and three solid gold
  for verified, with the two figures agreeing with the marks (claimed 9, verified 3).
- **Alt text**: "The passport shows claimed and verified progress as two separate totals that
  are never added together: nine region marks, six outlined for claimed and three filled
  amber for verified, with claimed at nine and verified at three kept deliberately apart."
- **Description**: A single flat passport page, centered, with a thin ruled header carrying the
  word passport. Its body is one row of nine square region marks, sized to fill the page
  width comfortably: the first six outlined in ink-navy, the last three solid amber-gold.
  Beneath the row sit two separate boxed totals, set far apart with open parchment between
  them and nothing joining them — the left reads claimed 9, the right reads verified 3. The
  figures agree with the marks above: nine marks in total, three of them gold. Nothing else
  appears on the page.
- **Prompt**:
  Goal: Show that claimed progress and verified progress are two separate figures the
    application never combines, that verified is always the smaller, and that only verified
    marks are gold.
  Scene: One flat passport page with a thin ruled header reading "passport". Below it, a
    single row of nine large square marks — the first six outlined ink-navy, the last three
    solid amber-gold. Below that, two separated boxed totals with wide open parchment between
    them and no line, bar or arrow joining them: the left box reads "claimed 9" and the right
    box reads "verified 3".
  Style: Flat vector, restrained and formal, thin rules, generous whitespace, subtle paper
    texture, amber-gold used only for verified marks, no shadows, no gradients.
  Aspect ratio: 3:2
  Background: warm parchment #f7f4ec
  Text in image: exactly three pieces of text — "passport", "claimed 9", "verified 3". No
    region names, no other numerals, no other text.
  Avoid: any number other than 9 and 3, a verified figure larger than the claimed figure,
    trophies, medals, stars, ribbons, a single progress bar merging the two values,
    percentage rings, confetti, document stacks, large empty areas, any sentence-length text
- **Result**: Generated 2026-10-22 after the program owner approved the plan. Nine marks, six
  outlined and three gold, "claimed 9" and "verified 3", and the only other text is
  "passport". Gemini reported 2,026 tokens and an estimated cost of $0.14 (the plan quoted
  about $0.12). The guide now uses this file; v2 stays on disk for comparison.

### Image 11: icon

- **File**: docs/media/brand/icon.png
- **Page**: Favicon, browser tab, sidebar, repository avatar
- **Alt text**: "The Golden Thread Quest: a gold four-point compass rose on a deep navy tile."
- **Description**: A single gold compass rose centred on a deep ink-navy rounded square,
  reduced to what survives at sixteen pixels. Four points only, solid tapered triangles
  meeting at the centre, the vertical axis slightly longer than the horizontal. One thin
  concentric gold ring behind the rose, clear of the point tips. Nothing else: no orbit, no
  badge, no degree marks, no glow. Flat fills, hard edges, two colors.
- **Prompt**:
  Goal: A flat vector app icon for a professional engineering training program. It must read
    instantly at 16 pixels in a browser tab, and it must look like it belongs to the same
    product as the flat field-guide diagrams inside the application.
  Scene: A single gold compass rose, centred, on a deep ink-navy rounded square tile. The rose
    has exactly four points — north, south, east, west — drawn as solid tapered triangles
    meeting at the centre, with the vertical axis slightly longer than the horizontal. One
    thin concentric gold ring sits behind the rose, not touching the point tips. Nothing else.
    The rose occupies roughly 70 percent of the tile width, with even margin on all four
    sides.
  Style: Flat vector. Solid fills only. Uniform stroke weight. Hard edges. Absolutely no
    gradients, no bevels, no bloom or glow, no drop shadows, no sparkles, no lens flare, no 3D
    shading, no reflections, no texture. The silhouette alone should carry the mark, as if cut
    from two colors of paper. Geometric, precise, slightly austere — an instrument engraved on
    a case, not an illustration of one. The compass rose and ring are amber-gold #c8962f and
    the field is ink navy #172433: two colors in the entire image and no others.
  Aspect ratio: 1:1 square
  Background: deep ink navy #172433, filling a rounded square tile with a generous corner
    radius, opaque, edge to edge, no border
  Text in image: none
  Avoid: eight-pointed or sixteen-pointed roses, orbital or elliptical rings, degree markings,
    tick marks, cardinal letters N E S W, needles, map contours, stars, sparkles, glow,
    gradients, cyan or teal of any kind, photorealism, glossy app-store styling, any third
    color, any text

### Image 12: icon-badged

- **File**: docs/media/brand/icon-badged.png
- **Page**: README header, decks, anywhere the mark is rendered large
- **Alt text**: "The Golden Thread Quest: a gold four-point compass rose on a deep navy tile,
  with a gold verification check at its lower right."
- **Description**: Image 11 with one addition, for sizes where a badge is legible. A small
  solid gold checkmark sits in the lower right inside a filled navy circle with a gold
  outline, overlapping the ring edge. The check is gold because gold is what verification
  means in this product. Kept as a separate file: the plain mark is the favicon, this one is
  for large renders only.
- **Prompt**:
  Goal: A flat vector brand mark for a professional engineering training program, for use at
    large sizes where a small badge is still legible.
  Scene: A single gold compass rose, centred, on a deep ink-navy rounded square tile. The rose
    has exactly four points — north, south, east, west — drawn as solid tapered triangles
    meeting at the centre, with the vertical axis slightly longer than the horizontal. One
    thin concentric gold ring sits behind the rose, clear of the point tips. In the lower
    right, overlapping the ring edge, a small filled navy circle with a thin gold outline
    holds a solid gold checkmark.
  Style: Flat vector. Solid fills only. Uniform stroke weight. Hard edges. Absolutely no
    gradients, no bevels, no bloom or glow, no drop shadows, no sparkles, no lens flare, no 3D
    shading, no reflections, no texture. Geometric, precise, slightly austere. The compass
    rose, ring, badge outline and checkmark are all amber-gold #c8962f and the field is ink
    navy #172433: two colors in the entire image and no others.
  Aspect ratio: 1:1 square
  Background: deep ink navy #172433, filling a rounded square tile with a generous corner
    radius, opaque, edge to edge, no border
  Text in image: none
  Avoid: a cyan, teal, green or white checkmark, eight-pointed or sixteen-pointed roses,
    orbital or elliptical rings, degree markings, cardinal letters, needles, stars, sparkles,
    glow, gradients, photorealism, glossy app-store styling, any third color, any text

### Image 13: icon-v2

- **File**: docs/media/brand/icon-v2.png
- **Fixes**: v1 drew an eight-point rose despite the entry asking for four, and kept the ring.
  Rendered at 16 pixels the short points and the ring merged into an indistinct gold blob.
  The ring is now gone and the four arms are described as a shape rather than as a count,
  because a count is what the model ignored.
- **Page**: Favicon, browser tab, sidebar, repository avatar
- **Alt text**: "The Golden Thread Quest: a gold four-pointed star on a deep navy tile."
- **Description**: A single gold four-pointed star centred on a deep ink-navy rounded square,
  filling most of the tile. Four long slender arms only — up, down, left, right — each a
  narrow isosceles triangle tapering from a wide base at the centre to a sharp tip, so the
  whole mark reads as a compass star. No ring, no circle, no intermediate points between the
  arms, no badge. Two colors, hard edges, flat fills.
- **Prompt**:
  Goal: A flat vector app icon that stays legible at 16 pixels in a browser tab. Legibility at
    that size outranks every other consideration.
  Scene: One gold four-pointed star centred on a deep ink-navy rounded square tile. The star
    has four arms and four arms only, pointing up, down, left and right, each a narrow
    isosceles triangle with a wide base meeting at the exact centre and a sharp tip. The
    vertical pair is slightly longer than the horizontal pair. The arm tips reach about 80
    percent of the way to the tile edge. The spaces diagonally between the arms are empty
    navy. There is no circle, no ring, no outline, no badge and no small points between the
    arms.
  Style: Flat vector. Two solid colors and nothing else. Hard edges, no outlines, no
    gradients, no bevels, no glow, no shadows, no texture, no 3D. The mark is amber-gold
    #c8962f and the field is ink navy #172433. Bold and simple enough to survive being shrunk
    to a thumbnail, like a maritime flag or a stencil.
  Aspect ratio: 1:1 square
  Background: deep ink navy #172433, a rounded square tile with a generous corner radius,
    opaque and filling the entire frame corner to corner with no white margin and no border
  Text in image: none
  Avoid: eight-pointed or sixteen-pointed compass roses, any ring or circle around the star,
    small secondary points between the four arms, degree marks, cardinal letters, needles,
    white or light margins outside the tile, cyan or teal, gradients, glow, 3D, any third
    color, any text

## Which icon to ship

Tested by rendering each at 16 pixels rather than by opinion.

| Mark | At 16px | At 32px+ | Distinctive? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `icon` (eight-point rose, ring) | a gold ring with a muddy centre | crisp and clearly a compass | yes, reads as nothing else |
| `icon-badged` | badge is an illegible smudge | good | yes, for large renders only |
| `icon-v2` (four-point star, no ring) | clean and unmistakable | crisp | **no** — it is the common AI sparkle glyph |

The trade is legibility against distinctiveness, and it does not resolve cleanly. `icon-v2`
wins the 16px test outright, but at every size it looks like the four-point sparkle now used
generically for anything AI, which is a poor mark for a product whose whole argument is that
its output is verified rather than generated. `icon` loses detail at 16px but a favicon is
recognised by colour and silhouette more than by detail, and gold-ring-on-navy is a
serviceable signature that belongs to this product alone.

Recommendation: ship `icon`, keep `icon-badged` for large renders, and hold `icon-v2` unless
the sparkle collision is judged acceptable.

## What was considered and left out

| Candidate | Why not |
|---|---|
| The golden thread as seven waypoints | It restates the one sentence it would sit beside. The thread is the product's name, not an idea a reader struggles with. Decoration. |
| Screenshots of any screen | Stale the moment a template changes. The guide describes the screens in words that stay true. |
| The review decision flow (Section 8) | Two outcomes, approve or request changes. Prose carries it in a sentence; a diagram would add a box per word. |
| Troubleshooting (Section 9) | Already a table. A table is the right shape for lookup. |
| Taking curriculum updates (Section 10) | A command sequence. Text is precise here and an image would be less so. |
| Known limitations (Section 12) | A list of eight independent facts with no structure between them. Nothing to draw. |

## Cost

| | |
|---|---|
| Images | 5 of 5 final; see which take each page ships, below |
| Provider | Gemini `gemini-3-pro-image-preview` |
| Round 1 actual | **$0.70** (5 images, 9,939 tokens, 89s) |
| Round 2 actual | **$0.58** (4 images: 3 corrections plus one retake) |
| Round 3 actual | **~$0.14** (1 image, 2,282 tokens, 17s) — derived at round 1's per-image rate, not separately metered |
| Round 4 actual | **$0.18** (1 image, 2,552 tokens, 19.9s) — image 15, the fourth ownership-zones take |

## If a take is wrong

Refinement is a new entry, not an edit: `01-first-hour-flow-v2.png` alongside the original,
its own plan entry, its own approval. Both versions stay on disk so they can be compared, and
the sidecar JSON records what changed between them.

## Approval state

Round 1 (images 1-5) was approved and generated on 2026-09-17.
Round 2 generated images 7, 9 and 10 (`02-state-authority-v2`,
`03-ownership-zones-v2` then `-v3`, `05-passport-outcome-v2`) on 2026-09-17.
Round 3 generated image 14, `01-first-hour-flow-v3`, on 2026-09-17 at 20:17.
Round 4 generated image 15, `03-ownership-zones-v4`, on 2026-09-22 at 06:27.
Image 6, `01-first-hour-flow-v2`, was never generated and never will be: the
division it drew stopped being true before it was worth buying. Image 14
replaces it.

**Invocation note.** Rebuilding the guide after a new image needs the `docs` extra,
`uv pip install -e '.[docs]'`, because `scripts/build_user_guide_html.py` re-encodes each
diagram as a WebP data URI and nothing the application ships imports Pillow.

`scripts/generate_images.py` resolves each entry's **File**
path under `--images-dir`, which defaults to `<project>/images`. Because this
plan's paths are written from the repository root, the run needs
`--images-dir .`; without it the output lands at `images/docs/media/images/`
and has to be moved by hand, which is what happened in round 4.

## Which take each page ships

Generating a correction and wiring it into the page are two separate acts, and round 2 did
only the first. Three of the five diagrams in `docs/USER-GUIDE.md` were still the superseded
round-1 takes until this table existed. It is the record of what the guide actually renders.

| Section | File the guide references | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 3 — The first hour | `01-first-hour-flow-v3.png` | Round 3 take; v1 and v2 superseded. |
| 3 — Choosing a quest | `06-quest-map.png` | Not generated: a screenshot of the Quest Map, taken by `scripts/screenshot_quest_map.py` after `make build`. Retake it whenever the map changes. |
| 4 — The eight states | `02-state-authority-v2.png` | v1 placed `locally validated` in the reviewer column, contradicting the one rule the image exists to state. |
| 6 — What the application writes | `03-ownership-zones-v4.png` | Round 4 take; the first one with no misleading text. See below. |
| 7 — Evidence | `04-evidence-package.png` | Correct in round 1; never superseded. |
| 11 — Knowing when you are finished | `05-passport-outcome-v3.png` | v3 draws nine region marks to match the nine regions since 0.3.0; v2 drew eight. v1 read `claimed 10601 / verified 10602`, showing verified exceeding claimed, which the application cannot produce; v2 fixed that and v3 keeps it (claimed 9, verified 3). |

### Why section 6 ships the v4 take

The ownership-zones image had no correct take for three rounds. v1 was right in every respect
except that it labelled the left zone "programme". v3 fixed the word and lost the spacing
between each folder label and the Git dot that followed it, printing "content ●" as "content."
and "generated ○" as "generatedo" — a legend a reader misreads as punctuation. v1 shipped in
the meantime because a wrong-register word is a smaller fault than that.

v4 stops asking for the thing that broke: Git membership moves off the individual labels and
onto the zone, as one chip per zone. Both earlier defects are gone — the heading reads
"program", and every folder label is a plain word with clear space after it.

Two deviations from the entry, both accepted rather than retaken:

- The three zones are drawn the same size. The entry asked for the centre zone to be visibly
  taller and wider so it anchors the composition. It is not, so the "only the middle zone is
  yours" emphasis rests on the gold border and on the prose beside the image rather than on
  scale.
- The centre chip is gold-outlined. The entry reserved gold for the centre region's border
  alone.

Neither misleads a reader, which is the bar the previous three takes failed. A v5 for the size
emphasis would be a new entry and a new approval.

The guide and the HTML build had drifted apart on this image as well: `docs/USER-GUIDE.md`
referenced v1 while `scripts/build_user_guide_html.py` embedded v3. Both now name v4, and the
HTML artifact was rebuilt so the embedded diagram matches.

## Why image 6 was skipped, and what it cost to wait

Kept because the reasoning was right and is worth reusing. Image 6 drew the first hour as
"in the app" against "in your terminal". That division was about to stop being true: the CLI
action layer was landing, and participants on the installed Cowork app have no terminal at
all. The lanes were both the thing the image teaches and the thing about to change, so
drawing it then bought an asset that would be rebought.

The wait cost one round's delay and saved one image. Image 14 divides by authority instead —
what the application does against what only the participant can do — which is true on every
surface and does not depend on which tool is open.

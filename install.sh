# Golden Thread Quest setup for Mac, Linux and Windows WSL (Phase 2A.1).

# Participants paste one line from docs/guides/PILOT.md:
#   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beekeeper-lab/golden-thread-quest/v0.3.1/install.sh | bash
#
# It installs what is missing (Apple's command line tools or Git, uv, the GitHub CLI),
# asking before each install. Then it signs the participant in to GitHub, forks and clones
# the repository, puts them on their own pilot branch at the release tag, installs the
# application, creates the `gtq` command and starts the application. Running it again is
# safe: every step checks first and skips what is already done.
#
# Test hooks, used by tests/integration/test_install_script.py and never by participants:
#   GTQ_TEST_SOURCE  clone this local repository instead of forking; skips GitHub entirely
#   GTQ_NAME         the participant's name, instead of asking
#   GTQ_ASSUME_YES   answer yes to every question
#   GTQ_NO_START     do not start the application at the end
#   GTQ_TEST_GH_DOWNLOAD  download the GitHub CLI even when one is installed (with a stub curl)

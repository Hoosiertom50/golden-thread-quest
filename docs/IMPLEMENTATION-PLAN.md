# Claude Code Implementation Plan

## How to use this file

This file is both the implementation backlog and restart point.

Claude must:

1. Work from the earliest incomplete stage.
2. Complete only one stage at a time.
3. Check an item only after its acceptance behavior and tests pass.
4. Update the stage log before stopping.
5. Audit the stage before advancing.
6. Fix blocking and high findings.
7. Rerun the audit and record the final result.

Do not check the stage heading until its audit passes.

## Global implementation rules

- [x] Work occurs in a feature branch, never directly on `main`.
- [x] Existing participant-owned files are preserved.
- [x] Changes remain within the current stage unless a documented prerequisite requires otherwise.
- [x] Every behavior change includes appropriate tests.
- [x] No test is weakened or deleted merely to obtain a passing build.
- [x] No generated file becomes an undocumented source of truth.
- [x] No external write occurs without preview and explicit confirmation.
- [x] Every architecture deviation is recorded in `docs/DECISIONS.md`.

---

## Stage 0 — Planning and feasibility audit

**Goal:** Confirm that this package is internally consistent, feasible, safe, and specific enough to implement.

### Tasks

- [x] Read the files listed in `CLAUDE.md` in order.
- [x] Inspect all schemas, examples, fixtures, and prototype screens.
- [x] Compare every required screen to the component catalog.
- [x] Compare content examples to schema requirements.
- [x] Identify duplicated, contradictory, missing, or untestable requirements.
- [x] Identify security assumptions needing proof or revision.
- [x] Confirm the Python/Jinja/local-service approach satisfies the first-release scope.
- [x] Recommend final package choices for Python versions, schema library, Markdown renderer, local service, test runner, formatter, and linter.
- [x] Record accepted choices in `docs/DECISIONS.md`.
- [x] Create `docs/audits/stage-00-planning-audit.md`.
- [x] Correct the planning package or document approved deviations.

### Audit gate

- [x] No unresolved blocking finding.
- [x] No unresolved high-severity contradiction.
- [x] Every deferred implementation choice has an owner and decision point.
- [x] The prototype and written specification agree on primary behavior.
- [x] Audit rerun result is `pass` or `pass-with-advisories`.

      silently — was fixed within the stage with `progress._check_stale_approval` and four
      tests, and confirmed closed as H3 in `docs/audits/stage-10-final-audit.md`).

### Stage completion

      `make verify-package`, which exports tracked files with `git archive` and installs,
      validates, and builds in a fresh virtual environment; it runs as the `clean-export` job
      in CI on every change. See DH1 in `docs/TRACEABILITY.md`.)
- [x] A new quest can be added without application-code changes.
- [x] A second person can run a quest, assemble proof, validate it, and review it.

- [x] Audit implementation details against Git diff and architecture.
- [x] Audit traceability for missing or unsupported claims.
- [x] Create and resolve `docs/audits/stage-04-to-09-implementation-audits.md` (implementation
      self-audit; the findings it missed — inaccurate traceability rows, wrong release-note
      counts, and `make check` never running the browser suite — were caught and closed as
      H2, M1 and the release-note fixes in `docs/audits/stage-10-final-audit.md`).

### Stage completion

- [x] **Stage 9 complete and audited**

---

## Stage 10 — Final independent audit and release decision

**Goal:** Decide whether the release candidate is ready for a pilot without relying on the implementation context that created it.

### Tasks

- [x] Create `docs/audits/final-audit.md`.
- [x] Produce a release recommendation: `release`, `release-with-advisories`, or `do-not-release`.
- [x] Fix blocking/high findings and rerun the final audit. (None within the release checklist's flows; `docs/audits/phase-01-verify.md`.)

### Release gate

- [x] No unresolved blocking or high findings.
- [x] All release acceptance criteria are checked or explicitly deferred with approval.
- [x] Implementation details describe what exists rather than what was planned.
- [x] Clean-clone reproduction succeeds.
- [x] Pilot limitations are visible to participants and reviewers.

### Stage completion

- [x] **Stage 10 complete and final release decision recorded** (`release-with-advisories`, to a pilot, decided by the program owner at Gate 1 on 2026-09-29; `docs/audits/final-audit.md`)

## Deferred work register

| ID | Description | Reason deferred | Target | Owner | Approval |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | Glossary content type (`content/glossary/`) | No schema, no sample, no screen renders one | Post-release | Curriculum maintainer | Stage 0 audit F5 |
| D2 | Coverage reporting | `pytest-cov` was installed with nothing configured; half-configured is worse than absent | **Post-release** (re-approved 2026-09-17: Stage 9 shipped without it) | Implementation | Stage 1 audit L1 |
| D3 | `attempts[].validation_result_ids` and `submission_id` consumers | Submission records are Stage 7 | Stage 7 | Implementation | Stage 2 audit M6 |
| D4 | `review.evidence_hash`, `review.quest_version` comparison, `hashing.hash_directory()` caller | Changed-evidence detection is Stage 7 | Stage 7 | Implementation | Stage 2 audit M6 |
| D5 | Validator-registry and submission schemas | Authored with the stages that use them | Stages 5 and 7 | Implementation | Stage 0 audit F7 |
| D7 | Live Environment Health checks (dependency versions, Git status, participant write test, external CLI presence, service binding) | A generated page cannot inspect the machine at the moment it is read; the five static checks say what was true at build time and label themselves as such | **Post-release**, through the local service (re-approved 2026-09-17) | Implementation | Stage 3 audit S3-M4 |
| D8 | A fixture exercising all eight quest states at once | The shipped fixture covers two; the rest are reached by mutating it in `tests/ui/test_states.py` | Post-release | Curriculum maintainer | Stage 6 audit F4 |
| D9 | Container or seccomp isolation for validators | Release one is policy plus process boundaries: a validator using `open()` directly bypasses `Workspace`. Disclosed in the release notes | Post-release | Implementation | Final re-audit, Job 2 |
| D10 | Secret-scanner coverage: keyword-distant assignments, bare 40-hex keys, base64 blobs, webhook URLs, any PII | The detectors are a safety net and are documented as one; widening them without a corpus risks false positives that make people route around the gate | Post-release | Implementation | Final re-audit R16 |
| D11 | Role separation between participant and reviewer | `/review/` sits in the primary navigation with no separation, so a participant can open the reviewer page for their own work. ADR-030 already states that release-one provenance is conventional | Post-release | Program owner | Final re-audit, Job 2 |
| D12 | A degraded view for an attempt whose evidence directory is missing | Today one deleted folder makes the whole site unbuildable until `progress.yaml` is hand-edited | Post-release | Implementation | Final re-audit R8 |
| D13 | Type-tagged evidence hash chunks | Tagging changes every stored digest, so every approved attempt would read as changed once; the empty-directory collision hides nothing | Post-release | Implementation | Round 17 E6 |
| D14 | Success notices after an action | The rebuilt page already shows the new state | Post-release | Implementation | Round 17 L13 |
| D15 | Quest-page section order | The body renders in authored order; changing it is a content-model decision | Post-release | Curriculum maintainer | Round 17 L15 |
| D16 | A per-test timeout for the scaling tests | Needs a new test dependency; best-of-three timing keeps the inputs small | Post-release | Implementation | Round 17 F9 |
| D6 | Presentation-only reserved fields (`quest.tools`, `author`, `last_reviewed`, `risk.notes`, `region.icon`, `badge.icon`, `track.focus_tags`, `site.professional_role`) | Consumed by pages that arrive in Stage 3 and Stage 6 | Stages 3 and 6 | Implementation | Stage 2 audit M6 |

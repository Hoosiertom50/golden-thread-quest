# The Golden Thread Quest — User Guide

You are doing this on your own, remotely, probably without anyone to ask. This guide assumes
that. It tells you what to install, what to do, what each thing means, what to do when
something goes wrong, and what "finished" actually looks like.

Read the first three sections before you start. The rest is reference.

---

## 1. What this actually is

A training program you work through in your own Git repository, on your own machine.

Most training either gives you videos or grades a quiz. This does neither. You do real work
— synchronize a Jira board, write a test, normalize a transcript into context an agent can
use — and you leave behind **evidence**: files, commands someone else can run, results from
automated checks. A human reviewer reads that evidence and decides whether it demonstrates
what the quest asked for.

Two things follow from that, and they shape everything else:

**Your work is files, not database rows.** Everything you produce lives under `participant/`
in your own repository. You can read it, edit it, commit it, and take it with you. If you
stopped using this application tomorrow, your portfolio would still be there and still make
sense.

**Nothing you do makes work "verified".** You can mark your own evidence ready. Automated
checks can pass. Neither produces verified completion — only a reviewer's approval does. That
is deliberate, and the application enforces it rather than trusting it.

---

## 2. Install it

This guide assumes you are using the installed **Cowork** desktop app. If you work in Claude
Code or a terminal instead, every instruction here has an obvious equivalent — where this says
"ask Claude to run X", you run X yourself.

### What you need

| | |
|---|---|
| Cowork | The desktop app, on macOS or Windows |
| Python | 3.10 or newer — the Cowork sandbox already has it |
| Git | 2.30 or newer — already in the sandbox |
| Disk | About 200 MB once installed |

No database and no Docker. The application and most quests need no account and no network
connection after install. The exceptions are the Jira Jungle, GitHub Caverns and Trello Islands
regions, which read from those systems and need an account, and the 19 quests in them that
write, which also need a sandbox project, repository or board you are allowed to change
(see [Section 3](#choosing-a-quest)).

### Do this

1. **Get the repository onto your machine.** Clone it, or unpack the archive you were given,
   into a folder you will keep. This is your portfolio; put it somewhere you would not delete.

2. **Open Cowork and connect that folder.** Cowork works inside the folders you connect to it
   and nowhere else, so this is the equivalent of changing directory in a terminal.

3. **Ask Claude to set it up.** In your own words, or literally:

   > Run `make setup`, then `make check`, and tell me if anything failed.

   `make check` runs formatting, linting, type checking, a YAML-safety rule, a secret scan and
   the full non-browser test suite. It takes a few minutes and works entirely offline. If it
   passes, your installation is sound. If it does not, go to [Section 9](#9-when-something-goes-wrong).

### How you read and do things

Two things work differently here than they would in a browser, and knowing this up front saves
an hour of confusion.

**You read quests as files.** The application generates a website, but that site is served
inside the sandbox and your browser is outside it. So rather than browsing, ask Claude to show
you a quest — it will read `content/quests/` and tell you what the brief and the acceptance
criteria are. Ask it to list what is available and it will.

**You change state with a command, not a button.** Every action has a command:

```
quest-app action --list
quest-app action start-quest --quest <quest-id> --confirm
```

Ask Claude to run them. It is the same action layer the web interface uses, with the same
rules applied — nothing here is a shortcut around anything.

### If you are in the pilot, or want one line

Pilot participants do not use Cowork or `make`. `docs/guides/PILOT.md` has the one-line
setup, and after it three commands cover everything outside the browser: `gtq start` opens the
application, `gtq hand-in` sends your work to GitHub and opens your pull request, and
`gtq get-review` brings your reviewer's decision back. The rest of this guide still applies:
the states, the evidence and what a reviewer looks for are the same.

### If you are in a terminal instead

```bash
git clone <your fork of the quest repository> golden-thread-quest
cd golden-thread-quest
make setup
source .venv/bin/activate
make check
make serve
```

`make serve` builds the site, starts a service bound to `127.0.0.1` only, and prints an
address to open. That path gives you the full web interface, and the buttons do what the
`quest-app action` commands do. It is not available from inside Cowork, because the server
would be in the sandbox and your browser is not.

## 3. Your first hour

![The first hour divides by authority, not by tool: the application starts the quest, runs checks, records the result and accepts the submission, while only you can do the work, write the proof and commit and push. Nothing in either lane reaches verified.](media/images/01-first-hour-flow-v3.png)

1. **Ask what to work on.** Ask Claude for the recommended quest and why. The recommendation
   is calculated, not guessed — it will be the same tomorrow given the same inputs.

2. **Read the whole quest before starting.** Especially *How this is judged* — those criteria
   are numbered, and a reviewer's findings will refer to them by number. Ask Claude to show
   you the full brief rather than a summary.

3. **Start it:** `quest-app action start-quest --quest <quest-id> --confirm`. Three things
   happen:
   - `participant/progress.yaml` is created if it did not exist
   - an evidence package appears at `participant/evidence/<quest-id>/<attempt-id>/`
   - a line is added to `participant/ACTIVITY.md` saying what was done

4. **Do the work in your repository.** The application is where you read the brief and record
   what happened; the work itself happens in the files. You can do it yourself or with
   Claude's help — what matters is that the evidence is real and you can explain it.

5. **Fill in `PROOF.md`.** It is a template with the questions a reviewer will ask. Answer
   them.

6. **Run the checks:** `quest-app action run-validator --quest <quest-id> --validator <id>`.
   Each one tells you what it looked at and what it found. A failing check is information,
   not a verdict.

7. **Then, in order:**

   ```
   quest-app action mark-evidence-ready   --quest <quest-id>
   quest-app action mark-locally-validated --quest <quest-id>
   quest-app action submit-for-review      --quest <quest-id> --confirm
   ```

   Each refuses if you are not entitled to it yet, and says what state it is legal from.

8. **Commit and push.** The application never does this for you — not in Cowork, not in a
   terminal. Ask Claude to commit and push, or do it yourself. Your work being in Git is what
   makes it a portfolio.

### Choosing a quest

There are 128 quests in nine regions, and the catalog page lists them all with their level and
XP. A quest is **locked** until the quests it depends on are verified, so the order within a
region is real. Some points that matter when choosing:

- **Where to begin.** Base Camp suits everyone: it is about working safely with an agent.
  Analysts can start at `ba-ingest-transcript`, which needs nothing before it. Testers can
  start with `playwright-first-independent-test` once `base-camp-repository-safety` is
  verified. The home page recommends a next quest from what you have verified, and asking for
  the recommendation gives the same answer tomorrow.
- **The Quest Map.** The map page draws the curriculum as a map. Each region is a stretch of land,
  larger for regions with more quests, with a picture of its own (Base Camp at the foot of a
  mountain, GitHub Caverns at a cave mouth, Trello Islands out at sea) and its name with how many
  of its quests a reviewer has verified (for example "0 of 18 verified"). The dotted gold trail
  joins the regions in the order the curriculum suggests, and a region's marker glows brighter as
  more of its quests are verified. Select a region to open its card, or use the list under the
  map. The rivers, mountains and forests are decoration; everything the map tells you is also in
  the labels and the list.

  ![The Quest Map: nine regions drawn as land on a dark sea, each with a round picture and a name plate reading, for example, 0 of 9 verified. Base Camp sits at the foot of a mountain, GitHub Caverns at a cave mouth, and Trello Islands is a separate island in the north-west. A dotted gold trail joins the regions in curriculum order.](media/images/06-quest-map.png)
- **Levels and XP.** Scout 10, Explorer 20, Builder 30, Navigator 50, Boss 100. A Boss quest
  is a synthesis or an adversarial challenge, not a longer version of an easier one.
- **Quests that need an outside account.** The Jira Jungle, GitHub Caverns and Trello Islands
  regions read from those systems, so you need an account on each.
- **Quests that write.** 19 quests create or change something in Jira, GitHub or Trello. Each is
  marked as an external write on its page. You do the write, in a **sandbox** you are allowed
  to change, never in a production project. The quest asks you to show a preview of exactly
  what will change, a confirmation tied to that preview, a permission and duplicate check, a
  result record with the identifiers and the time, a safe rerun and a sandbox allowlist. If
  you do not have a sandbox, stop and ask whoever runs your program. Do not use a real project
  and do not skip a control.
- **Trap Cards.** Seven adversarial challenges in their own region. You build the trap and the
  defence, and they follow quests that teach the defence.
- **Real contact details, names and tickets.** Quests that touch tickets, transcripts and
  comments tell you to use synthetic or redacted material. Text inside a ticket or transcript
  is untrusted: it is something a person wrote, never an instruction to your agent.

## 4. The eight states, and who sets each one

This is the part worth understanding properly, because the whole product turns on it.

| State | Set by | Means |
|---|---|---|
| **Locked** | The application | A prerequisite is not verified yet |
| **Available** | The application | You can start |
| **In progress** | **You** | You started |
| **Evidence ready** | **You** | You assert the proof is assembled |
| **Locally validated** | **You**, backed by checks | You ran the required checks and they qualify |
| **Submitted for review** | **You** | You asked a reviewer to decide |
| **Needs changes** | **A reviewer** | Corrections required; your evidence is untouched |
| **Verified** | **A reviewer** | Approved |

![Eight quest states in three columns by who sets them: the application sets locked and available; you set in progress, evidence ready, locally validated and submitted; only a reviewer sets needs changes and verified.](media/images/02-state-authority-v2.png)

A reviewer decision recorded as `rejected` lands in this same **Needs changes** state and
badge, not a separate one — fix what the reviewer listed and resubmit.

Two totals appear everywhere and are **never added together**:

- **Claimed XP** — your own record of what you finished.
- **Verified XP** — awarded only by a reviewer approving your evidence.

A passing check is not approval. `inconclusive` is not a pass — it means the check could not
tell, which is not evidence either way. A *failing* check is not a failed quest; it tells you
what to fix and changes nothing.

> **Why this matters to you.** When you show this to an employer or a lead, "verified"
> means a named person read your evidence and said it held up. That is worth something
> precisely because you could not award it to yourself.

---

## 5. Working alone: how to not get stuck

You have no one to ask. These are the things that unstick people.

**Read the acceptance criteria first, and again before you submit.** They are numbered and
they are the standard you will be judged against. If you cannot point at the evidence that
satisfies criterion 4, you are not ready to submit.

**Write `PROOF.md` as you go, not at the end.** It asks what you built, where the artifacts
are, how to reproduce the behavior, what you validated, and what limitations remain. Writing
it last means reconstructing it; writing it as you go means it is true.

**A reviewer should not have to hunt.** Repository-relative paths, exact commands, and say
what you could *not* get working. Naming a limitation is a strength — it is the difference
between someone who finished and someone who understands what they finished.

**When a check fails, read the finding, not just the outcome.** Each one says what it
evaluated, what it observed, and what to do. They are ordered with the most serious first.

**If you are stuck for more than an hour**, do the smallest honest thing: write down in
`PROOF.md` exactly where you got to and what you tried, mark the evidence ready, and submit.
Submission is refused while a required file is missing or empty, so put what you have in
each one, even if that is a note saying what is not done yet.
A reviewer asking for changes with a concrete finding is worth more than another hour alone.

**Commit often.** Your work is in Git. `git status`, `git stash list` and `git reflog` have
recovered more work than any backup.

---

## 6. What the application writes, and what it never does

![Three ownership zones side by side: program-owned content and application code, your own work and evidence, and machine-owned generated output that is disposable. Only the middle zone is yours, and nothing the application does replaces it.](media/images/03-ownership-zones-v4.png)

**Inside `participant/`, only these, only through documented actions:**

- `progress.yaml` — your state. Written atomically and validated before it lands, so an
  interrupted save cannot leave it broken.
- `evidence/**` — your evidence packages, validation results, submission and review records.
- `ACTIVITY.md` — one line per change the application made, for you to read.

**It also rewrites `generated/`** on every action. That is machine-owned, gitignored and
disposable; `make build` recreates it.

**It never:** commits, pushes, merges, rebases, cleans, or opens a pull request. It never
writes outside `participant/`. `make clean` removes generated output and refuses to touch
anything of yours — there is a test that proves it.

**It never sends anything anywhere.** No telemetry, no accounts, no remote requests. The
generated pages load no remote script, font or image.

---

## 7. Evidence that holds up

![Forms of evidence, strongest first: a repository artifact, then reproducible instructions, then automated execution evidence, then a demonstration. Above them all sits reviewer approval, which evidence earns but never becomes.](media/images/04-evidence-package.png)

Preferred, strongest first:

1. **A repository artifact** — code, a test, a config, a normalized context file.
2. **Reproducible instructions** — exact commands, ideally from a clean clone.
3. **Automated execution evidence** — a validation result, a test run, a log.
4. **A demonstration** — you walking someone through it.
5. **A reviewer's approval.**

Screenshots support the others; they are not the proof. A screenshot shows something
happened once on your machine. A command someone else can run shows it happens.

**Every required file has to be there before you submit.** A submission is refused while
any required file, folder or command record on the evidence page reads *Not detected* or
*Needs attention*, and the refusal names each one.

**Never put a secret in evidence.** The application scans before you can mark evidence ready
or submit, and refuses if it finds one — it reports the file and line and never the value.
That scan is a safety net, not a guarantee. Credentials belong in your environment or an
authenticated CLI, never in a file you commit.

---

## 8. Getting reviewed

Submitting captures a fingerprint of your evidence at that moment. If you change it
afterwards, the reviewer is told — and they cannot approve changed evidence without explicitly
acknowledging they have re-read it.

**To approve, a reviewer must write a verification statement** in their own words saying what
they checked and how. **To ask for changes, they must record at least one finding.** A
decision you cannot act on is not allowed.

**Reviewers in Cowork use the command line too.** `make serve` is unreachable there for
the same reason it is unreachable for you, so a reviewer records a decision with
`quest-app action record-review`. `docs/guides/REVIEWER.md` has the commands.

**If you get "needs changes":** your evidence is preserved exactly as it was. Read the
findings, resume the quest, address them, and resubmit. This is the normal path, not a
failure.

**One limitation, stated plainly:** this release identifies a reviewer by the name in the
record and by Git history. Review records are not cryptographically signed. If your program
needs stronger proof of who approved what, review through pull requests so the Git history
carries the identity. `docs/guides/REVIEWER.md` says the same thing to reviewers.

---

## 9. When something goes wrong

| Symptom | What it means | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| An action is refused | The page says so at the top, in red, with the reason. Nothing changed | Fix what the reason names, try again |
| `make setup` cannot find uv | uv is not installed | Install from <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/>, or `python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -e ".[dev]"` |
| The build fails and you cannot tell why | Content does not validate, so nothing was published | `make validate-content` prints file, field and a suggested fix. A failed `make build` also writes `local-data/build-errors/index.html` |
| `make serve` refuses to start | You passed a bind address that is not loopback | It binds to `127.0.0.1` only, by design. Drop the `--host` |
| The printed `make serve` address will not open | You are in Cowork; the server is inside the sandbox and your browser is outside it | Expected. Use `quest-app action` commands instead — they do everything the buttons do |
| `make setup` fails on the Python version | Your interpreter is older than 3.10 | Ask Claude to check `python3 -V`. The Cowork sandbox ships 3.10, which is supported |
| A `quest-app action` command says the action is not possible | The transition is not legal from your current state | The message names the states it *is* legal from. Ask Claude what state you are in |
| A command's error ends "— confirm it, then try again." | The action is one of the ones you confirm before it happens (`start-quest`, `submit-for-review`, `record-review`); you ran it without `--confirm` | Add `--confirm` to the command and run it again |
| "only possible from…" | The transition is not legal from your current state | The message names the states it *is* legal from |
| A check says `inconclusive` | It could not tell — not a failure | The finding says what was missing |
| The site looks unstyled from disk | You opened `generated/index.html` directly | Reading from disk works; controls do not. In Cowork, ask Claude to read the quest files instead |
| Buttons do nothing | The service is not running, or you are on a stale page | Check `make serve` is up, then reload. In Cowork there are no buttons — use the commands |
| Your work seems lost | It is in Git | `git status`, `git stash list`, `git reflog` |

Two commands worth remembering:

```bash
make validate-content   # is my content and state consistent?
make check              # is my whole installation sound?
```

---

## 10. Taking curriculum updates

```bash
make update-check
```

It tells you whether it is safe and prints the commands. **It runs no merge** — merging on
your repository with your uncommitted work in it is not a decision an application should make.

A dirty working tree is a hard stop, not a warning. The printed sequence creates a backup
branch first, so there is always one command that puts everything back.

If the shape of `participant/progress.yaml` changes, `make update-check` says so before you
merge. After merging with your work committed, run `make migrate` to bring your file forward;
it validates before and after, and refuses to drop an attempt or a field.

**Version 0.3.0 added 120 quests and changed none of the original eight.** Taking it adds the
new quests to your catalog and leaves your progress file as it was. If you have verified a
quest, it stays verified.

**Your in-progress attempts stay on the quest version you started.** If a quest moves from
version 2 to 3 while you are working, you keep working against version 2 and the page tells
you a newer one exists. **Verified work stays verified** — a new version does not revoke an
approval.

Full detail: `docs/guides/UPDATING.md`.

---

## 11. Knowing when you are finished

There is no completion certificate, and that is the point. What you have at the end is:

- a **passport** showing verified capability by region, with claimed and verified kept apart;
- a **repository** of real artifacts, reproducible instructions and validation results;
- a **review history** of named people saying your evidence held up.

That is the thing you show someone. It is worth more than a score because none of it is
self-assessed.

![The passport shows claimed and verified progress as two separate totals that are never added together: nine region marks, six outlined for claimed and three filled amber for verified, with claimed at nine and verified at three kept deliberately apart.](media/images/05-passport-outcome-v3.png)

---

## 12. Known limitations

Read these before you rely on the application for anything that matters. The full list, with
reasons, is in `docs/RELEASE-NOTES.md`.

1. **Reviewer identity is conventional, not cryptographic.** See Section 8.
2. **Recording a decision needs the local service running.** Reading evidence does not.
3. **Reviewer-awarded badges cannot be awarded yet.** Meeting the criteria shows "pending";
   there is no badge-award record type in this release. Granting one by arithmetic would be
   exactly the blurring of authority the product exists to prevent.
4. **Environment Health reports what was true at build time**, not live.
5. **Validator isolation is policy plus process boundaries**, not a container. A validator is
   program-owned and reviewed like code; it is not sandboxed against a hostile author.
6. **Catalog filtering needs JavaScript.** Region and tag pages work without it.
7. **The secret scanner is a safety net**, not a guarantee. It will not catch every shape.
   It reads text evidence files up to 2 MB each. A larger log blocks submission until you
   trim it to the part that shows the result.
8. **Clean-clone installation is tested one step short of a real clone.** The `clean-export`
   CI job runs `make verify-package`, which exports tracked files with `git archive`, then
   installs, validates, and builds in a fresh virtual environment on every change. See DH1 in
   `docs/TRACEABILITY.md`.
9. **The evidence page's Repository panel is also build-time, not live.** Branch, changed and
   untracked counts, and "Evidence committed" reflect the moment this page was last built. A
   commit, edit, or revert made afterward will not show here until the site is rebuilt — any
   action rebuilds it, or run `make build`.
10. **The 120 quests added in 0.3.0 have been checked by independent audit passes, not yet read
    by the people they are written for.** If a quest is unclear, that is a finding about the
    quest, not about you; tell whoever runs your program.
11. **The 19 quests that write to an outside system need a sandbox** that your program has to
    provide. The application itself performs no external write, so the preview, the
    confirmation and the result record are your evidence and a reviewer reads them; nothing
    in the product stops a write to the wrong place.

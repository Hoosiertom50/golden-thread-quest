# Part 7. Where we are, and the phase plan

This part is the project's plan. It says what the goal is, where the work stands, how every
phase of the remaining work runs, and which phases remain. It replaces the audit-status part
of versions 1.x.

**The rule this part exists to enforce: scope changes only at a phase gate.** Between gates
the current phase's scope is frozen. A new idea, from anyone, goes to
`docs/PARKING-LOT.md` and is decided at the next gate, not acted on.

## 7.1 The goal

Put the Golden Thread Quest in front of real participants and a reviewer, learn from what
they do, and grow the curriculum and the application in the order that learning says is
most valuable.

The first release is a **pilot**: a small number of participants, working locally, on the
quests that exist today, with the known limitations written down (Section 7.6). It is not a
finished curriculum and not a hardened product. Everything after the pilot is chosen at a
gate.

## 7.2 Where we are (2026-10-05)

**Current phase: Phase 2B, the pilot run. It starts when the program owner sends the invitation for 0.2.4 (`docs/guides/PILOT-LEAD.md`).** Phase 2A.2 passed its gate on 2026-10-05: its demo was the first run of setup against real GitHub, and it found and fixed a defect that had stopped every participant at step 5 (Section 7.4, Phase 2A.2). The hand-in was rehearsed at `v0.2.0` with two local clones on 2026-09-29 and passes along the path `PILOT.md` describes (`docs/pilot/PILOT-LOG.md`). Setup's fork step now works against real GitHub. The pull request a hand-in opens is still tested only by the first real hand-in. Gate 1 passed on 2026-09-29, when the
program owner decided to release to a pilot. Phase 1's checklist passed and DH7 is closed
(`docs/audits/phase-01-verify.md`). Phase 2A fixes the two parking-lot items the program
owner chose and builds the release. Phase 2B is the pilot itself.

### How we got here

**The application is built.** Stages 0 to 9 of `docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md` were completed
and audited on 2026-09-16 and 2026-09-17. Everything Parts 1 to 6 describe exists, with
1382 tests under `make check` and 57 browser-driven tests under `make test-ui`. Eight quests
ship, one per region.

**The last twelve days went to one open criterion.** Stage 10, the release decision, has one
unchecked criterion: DH7, "the final audit reports no unresolved blocking or high findings."
Its closing rule required an independent round that finds no blocking or high finding at
all. Seventeen rounds ran, from 2026-09-17 to 2026-09-29. Every round found at least one,
every finding was fixed with a test, and the next round, pointed at new angles and at the new
fixes, found more.

**What that taught us.** The rounds found real defects: round 12 found that every browser
form was refused, and round 17 found that the page showed a proof path the gates did not
read. But the closing rule had no bound. A fresh adversarial reviewer can always find
something in 15,000 lines of code, so the loop could not end on its own, and each round
widened the scope a little: a broader secret scanner, integrity checks, timing tests. None
of those widenings was a decision the program owner made at a checkpoint, and no working
build was shown to the program owner along the way.

**What stops now.** Round 18 is not run. The per-round audit loop is replaced by the phase
method below. The audit records under `docs/audits/` stay as history.

| Round | Blocking | High | | Round | Blocking | High |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|---:|---:|
| 1 (final audit) | 3 | 4 | | 10 | 1 | 8 |
| 2 | 1 | 3 | | 11 | 0 | 3 |
| 3 | 1 | 2 | | 12 | 2 | 4 |
| 4 | 0 | 10 | | 13 | 2 | 3 |
| 5 | 0 | 9 | | 14 | 0 | 3 |
| 6 | 2 | 6 | | 15 | 0 | 3 |
| 7 | 1 | 8 | | 16 | 0 | 2 |
| 8 | 0 | 7 | | 17 | 1 | 5 |
| 9 | 0 | 8 | | | | |

*Each round's record is `docs/audits/round-NN-independent-audit.md`; rounds 1 to 3 are in
`stage-10-final-audit.md` and `stage-10-final-re-audit.md`. An outside review on 2026-09-17
(`external-review-2026-09-17.md`) called the engine a release candidate and the curriculum
too thin.*

## 7.3 How every phase runs

Every phase has the same five steps. What changes from phase to phase is only the scope.

1. **Plan, then freeze.** At the gate before the phase, this part records the phase's goal,
   its scope as a numbered list, what is out of scope, a *done-when* checklist of things that
   can be shown true or false, the demo, and a budget in working sessions. Once the program
   owner approves it, the scope does not change until the next gate.
2. **Build.** Only the numbered scope items. Work happens on feature branches and merges to
   `main` on the implementer's judgment, as `CLAUDE.md` rule 2 allows. An idea that is not
   in scope goes to `docs/PARKING-LOT.md` with one line saying why it might matter.
3. **Verify.** One independent review, in a fresh context, checks the done-when list and
   nothing else. A blocking or high finding *inside the scope* is fixed, and only that fix is
   re-checked. A finding outside the scope goes to the parking lot. **At most two verify
   cycles**; if the phase still fails, it stops and goes to the gate as it is.
4. **Demo.** The program owner runs the phase's result, following written steps, and sees
   it work.
5. **Gate.** The design document gets a new minor version (the rule is in
   `REGENERATING.md`), recording what was done, what was learned and what changed. The
   parking lot is triaged: each item is scheduled into a phase, left in the lot, or cut.
   Then the program owner chooses the next phase and approves its plan.

**Two stop rules** end a phase early and go straight to the gate:

- the phase has used half again its budget (for example, a third session on a two-session
  phase);
- a safety or data-loss problem turns up outside the phase's scope. It is reported, not
  fixed on the spot, so the program owner decides whether it outranks the plan.

## 7.4 The phases

Every piece of remaining work the project knows about is in one of these phases or in the
parking lot. Phase 1 is planned in full. Later phases are sketched, and each one is planned
in full at the gate before it, using what the earlier phases taught. Each item carries a
recommendation: **do**, **decide** (at that phase's gate, likely on pilot evidence), or
**cut** (recommended not to do in the foreseeable future).

### Phase 0: Reset and plan (this version)

- **Goal:** stop the audit loop and put the plan in one document the program owner can read.
- **Done when:** this part is merged; `docs/PARKING-LOT.md` exists; `CLAUDE.md` states the
  phase rule; `PLANNING-STATUS.md` points here.
- **Gate 0 (2026-09-29): passed.** The program owner approved Phase 1 as written and the
  closing-rule change in its item 2.

### Phase 1: Pilot release decision (done)

- **Goal:** decide on a fixed checklist whether the application as built goes to a pilot,
  and let the program owner see it working.
- **Budget:** two sessions.
- **Scope:**
  1. **Housekeeping.** Remove the stale round 17 worktrees under `.worktrees/`, their local
     branches and `backup/round-17-before-rewrite`. Delete the remote `chore/round-*` and
     `fix/r*` branches that are merged into `main`.
  2. **Replace DH7's closing rule** with the release checklist in item 3: DH7 closes when
     every item in it passes and one verify pass finds no blocking or high finding *within
     those flows*. Approved at Gate 0.
  3. **The release checklist**, run for real, not by test client:
     1. CI is green on `main`, every job.
     2. A true `git clone` from GitHub, then `make setup`, `make check`, `make setup-ui` and
        `make test-ui`, all pass.
     3. **Participant flow:** open the site with `make serve`, pick a quest, start it, build
        its evidence, run its validator, and submit it.
     4. **Reviewer flow:** open the submission, ask for changes with a finding; the
        participant fixes and resubmits; the reviewer approves; the passport shows verified
        completion and verified XP, while claimed progress stays visibly separate.
     5. **Maintainer flow:** add a sample quest as one Markdown file; after `make build` it
        appears in its region, the catalog, search and its tag page with no change to UI code.
     6. **Failure flow:** break a content file; the build names the file and field, and the
        last good site stays up.
  4. **A demo walkthrough**, `docs/guides/DEMO.md`: the checklist's flows 3 to 6 as numbered
     steps the program owner can follow in about fifteen minutes.
  5. **The release record.** `docs/audits/final-audit.md` gets the checklist results and a
     recommendation, expected to be `release-with-advisories`; Stage 10's boxes in
     `docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md` are checked; `docs/RELEASE-NOTES.md` and the `README`
     status note say "pilot".
- **Out of scope:** round 18's targets; every item in Phases 3 to 7; any new hardening.
- **Done when:** items 1 to 5 are complete, every checklist item passes, and the verify pass
  finds no blocking or high finding within the checklist's flows.
- **Demo:** the program owner follows `docs/guides/DEMO.md`.
- **Result:** every checklist item passed. CI on `main` first failed on a start-up race,
  which pull request 18 fixed. The verify pass found three Low wording problems in the demo,
  all fixed. Five observations are in the parking lot. See `docs/audits/phase-01-verify.md`.
- **Gate 1 (2026-09-29): passed.** The program owner decided to release to a pilot of about
  two participants, after fixing the two parking-lot items about missing proof.

### Phase 2A: Pilot release

- **Goal:** a tagged release that two participants can take up from a Slack message, with
  the two missing-proof gaps closed.
- **Budget:** one session.
- **Scope:**
  1. **Refuse a submission that is missing required proof.** A required file, folder or
     command record that the evidence page shows as *Not detected* or *Needs attention*
     (empty) blocks submission, and the refusal names each one. Validators stay advisory at
     submission, as they are today, and demonstrations cannot be detected, so they are not
     checked.
  2. **An unfilled `PROOF.md` fails the Base Camp check.** A proof document that is still
     the template, with headings and nothing under them, is a `fail`, not an advisory. The
     check still looks at what the document says, not whether files exist, as
     `docs/VALIDATOR-CONTRACT.md` asks.
  3. **The release.** Version 0.2.0, the README and release notes say "pilot", and a Git tag
     `v0.2.0` has a GitHub release whose notes link the pilot guide.
  4. **`docs/guides/PILOT.md`**, for participants. It covers what they need installed,
     forking and setup, the two pilot quests (Base Camp required, BA Ruins' transcript quest
     if there is time), how to hand in evidence, how to send feedback, and a warning that
     forks of a public repository are public, so the pilot uses fictional material only.
  5. **`docs/guides/PILOT-LEAD.md`**, for the program owner. It holds the Slack message
     ready to paste, how to review a participant's evidence from their fork, what feedback
     to collect, and when the pilot ends.
- **Out of scope:** the other three parking-lot items and everything in Phases 3 to 7.
- **Done when:** items 1 to 5 are complete, with tests for 1 and 2 that fail without the
  fix. `make check` and CI pass on `main`. A verify pass acting as a new participant follows
  `PILOT.md` from the release through a Base Camp submission, then follows `PILOT-LEAD.md`'s
  review steps, and finds no blocking or high finding.
- **Demo:** the program owner reads the Slack message and `PILOT.md`, then sends the message.
- **Result:** built and verified. The verify pass (`docs/audits/phase-02a-verify.md`) found two
  high findings in cycle 1: refusals were cut short, and reviewing from a clone always showed
  a false "evidence changed" warning. Both were fixed and passed in cycle 2. The fork and
  pull-request step on GitHub itself is untested.

### Phase 2A.1: Setup and hand-in for non-developers (done)

Added on 2026-09-30, before the invitation was sent. The program owner confirmed that
participants are business analysts and manual testers, not developers, and approved this
scope. For them, 0.2.0 asks for too much terminal and Git work before the first quest.

- **Goal:** a participant who has never used Git gets from the Slack message to the
  running application, hands in a quest and gets the review back, each with one command.
- **Budget:** about a day.
- **Scope:**
  1. **`install.sh`, one pasted line on Mac, Linux or WSL.** It installs what is missing
     (uv, which brings its own Python, and the GitHub CLI), asking before each install. It
     signs the participant in to GitHub in the browser, forks and clones the repository,
     creates their pilot branch at the release tag, installs the application and starts it.
  2. **`gtq start`, `gtq hand-in` and `gtq get-review`.** Hand-in commits the participant's
     folder, pushes it and opens or updates their pull request. Get-review pulls the
     reviewer's decision and explains any refusal in plain words. Each works from any folder.
  3. **`PILOT.md` rewritten for a non-developer.** It says what they will see after each
     step, and it uses no Git vocabulary they do not need.
  4. **Release 0.2.1.** The invitation points at the `v0.2.1` guide.
- **Out of scope:** native Windows. The file-safety layer relies on Mac and Linux
  operating-system features, so a port is a separate decision at Gate 2. Also out of scope:
  WSL setup on Windows, until the participants say whether they use Windows; and any quest
  content change.
- **Done when:** a test drives hand-in and get-review against local repositories and a
  stand-in for the GitHub CLI. `install.sh` runs to a working application in a clean Linux
  container, with GitHub sign-in and forking stubbed out. `make check` and CI pass. The
  program owner reads the new `PILOT.md`.
- **Demo:** the program owner runs `install.sh` on their own machine.
- **Result:** built and verified (`docs/audits/phase-02a1-verify.md`). Cycle 1 found two high
  findings: an edit after hand-in could leave the copy stuck, and re-running setup with a
  differently typed name hid all progress. Both were fixed and passed in cycle 2. The macOS
  path and real GitHub sign-in, forking and pull requests are untested until the demo.

### Phase 2A.2: First-day fixes for non-developers (done)

Added on 2026-10-04, before the invitation was sent. At the gate after Phase 2A.1 the
program owner chose three parking-lot items that would stop a business analyst or manual
tester on their first day, and approved this scope. Phase 2A.1's demo (the program owner
running `install.sh`) moves to this phase's demo, on 0.2.2.

- **Goal:** nothing a participant does on day one is silently lost, refused or aimed at a
  developer.
- **Budget:** one session.
- **Scope:**
  1. **Hand-in names what it left out.** A file under `participant/` that matches
     `.gitignore` (`*.token`, `**/secrets/` and the rest) is still not committed, but
     `gtq hand-in` lists each one, says the reviewer will not see it, and says what to do if
     it is proof the quest asks for.
  2. **`install.sh` makes no unauthenticated GitHub API call.** The GitHub CLI's latest
     version is read from the `github.com` release redirect, which is not rate-limited the
     way the API's 60 requests an hour per address is.
  3. **BA Ruins' transcript quest is the required first quest.** Its Base Camp
     prerequisite is removed (quest version 4). A pilot track lists it first and Base Camp
     second, and new participants start on that track. The recommendation follows the
     track's order, so the home page offers the transcript quest first and Base Camp after
     it. `PILOT.md` and `PILOT-LEAD.md` say the same.
  4. **Release 0.2.2.** The setup line and the invitation point at `v0.2.2`.
- **Out of scope:** every other parking-lot item, native Windows and WSL, and any change to
  a quest's acceptance criteria or proof.
- **Done when:** items 1 to 4 are complete, with tests for 1 to 3 that fail without the
  change. `make check`, `make test-ui` and CI pass on `main`. A verify pass acting as a new
  participant follows `PILOT.md` from the home page through the transcript quest's
  hand-in, with an ignored file in the folder, and finds no blocking or high finding.
- **Demo:** the program owner runs the `v0.2.2` setup line on their own machine, sees the
  home page offer the transcript quest, and runs `gtq hand-in` once.
- **Result:** built and verified (`docs/audits/phase-02a2-verify.md`). Cycle 1 found two
  high findings: the home page's "Start at" box named Base Camp above the transcript quest,
  and every hand-in listed the application's own lock file as a secret. Both were fixed and
  passed in cycle 2, with two medium findings (an untested build path, and ignored files in
  the evidence hash). Released as 0.2.2.
- **Demo (2026-10-04 and 05):** the program owner ran setup on their own Linux machine.
  It stopped at step 5 for every participant: the fork was made and then checked through a
  field the GitHub tool does not have (D1, blocking). Fixed in 0.2.3, with a test that runs
  the GitHub step against recorded GitHub responses. On the second run setup finished, and
  the home page offered the transcript quest first. Two low findings: the owner's account
  was told to rename a repository (D2, fixed in 0.2.3), and idle browser connections printed
  "Request timed out" lines (D3, fixed in 0.2.4). A real `gtq hand-in` was not run; the
  first participant's hand-in tests the pull request on GitHub.
- **What we learned:** a test hook that skips an external system also skips every
  assumption about that system's answers. Both verify passes used the hook, and only the
  demo reached GitHub. Tests of an external step now answer from recorded real responses.
- **Gate (2026-10-05):** the parking lot stays as it is until the pilot report, as at
  Gate 1; Phase 2B allows only fixes for a defect that stops a participant.

### Phase 2B: Pilot run

- **Goal:** watch two participants and one reviewer use the application, and collect what
  confuses, blocks or delights them.
- **Budget:** calendar time. The program owner sets the end date in the Slack message, and
  two weeks is suggested.
- **Scope:** code changes only for a defect that stops a participant from continuing. Every
  other observation goes to the parking lot.
- **Output:** a pilot report that ranks what to change. It is the main input to Gate 2 and to
  choosing among Phases 3 to 7.

### Phase 3: Participant and reviewer experience

Known items, likely joined by pilot findings. The ones marked **do** were found while
using the application; the others wait for evidence.

| Item | Source | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| A degraded view for an attempt whose evidence folder is missing, instead of an unbuildable site | D12 | Do: one deleted folder breaks everything today |
| Reviewer-awarded badges: a badge-award record so they can be granted | Known limitation 4 | Do if the pilot uses badges |
| Role separation between participant and reviewer pages | D11 | Decide |
| Success notices after an action | D14 | Decide |
| Showing the quest version an attempt started on, not only the current one | Known limitation 10 | Decide |
| Quest-page section order | D15 | Decide |
| Deeper gamification than the quest framing implies | External review 9 | Decide, with the curriculum |

### Phase 4 onward: Curriculum

The outside review's main finding was that the curriculum is thin: eight quests, one per
region. `docs/CURRICULUM-BACKLOG.md` proposes 128: Base Camp 9, Jira Jungle 23, Trello
Islands 17, GitHub Caverns 18, Context Library 12, BA Ruins 13, Scrum Village 9, Playwright
Labyrinth 20, and 7 hidden challenges.

- **One region per phase**, in an order chosen at each gate. The recommended first is
  **Base Camp**, because every other region builds on its safety quests.
- Each curriculum phase includes the validators its quests need and a glossary content type
  if the region's quests need one (D1).
- A quest that writes to Jira, Trello or GitHub must meet the preview-and-confirm conditions
  in `docs/SECURITY-AND-PRIVACY.md` first. The first region with such quests carries that
  capability as its own scope item.
- **Recommendation:** decide how many regions to build after the pilot. The full 128 is a
  plan, not a promise.
- **Plan:** `08-curriculum-plan.md` (2026-10-20) orders the regions and sizes the 120 unbuilt quests.
  At the program owner's instruction, all nine steps (C1 to C9) were built, audited and merged on
  2026-10-20 and 2026-10-21 while the pilot runs, and released as 0.3.0. The curriculum now has
  128 quests in nine regions. See `docs/audits/curriculum-final-audit.md`.

### Phase 5: Engineering hygiene

| Item | Source | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| A scheduled CI job that runs a true `git clone` and setup | Known limitation 9 | Do; Phase 1 runs it once by hand |
| Coverage reporting | D2 | Decide |
| A fixture that holds all eight quest states at once | D8 | Decide |
| A per-test timeout for the scaling tests | D16 | Decide |
| Splitting the largest modules, with complexity limits | External review 7 | Decide, only if a later phase is slowed by them |

### Phase 6: Security hardening

Release one's controls are documented in Part 5. These go further. They matter when
validators or quests come from authors the program does not review, which is not the case
today.

| Item | Source | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| Container or seccomp isolation for validators | D9 | Cut until third-party validators exist |
| Reaching a validator grandchild that starts its own session | Round 12 E9 | Cut, same reason; it depends on D9 |
| Wider secret-scanner coverage | D10 | Decide, only on a real false negative from the pilot |
| Scanning binary and compressed files | Known limitation 8 | Cut; the participant's confirmation in `PROOF.md` covers it |
| Type-tagged evidence hash chunks | D13 | Cut; it re-flags every approved attempt and closes a gap that hides nothing |

### Phase 7: New capabilities

Named in the specification and not built. Each is a product decision, not a fix.

| Item | Source | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| Live Environment Health checks through the local service | D7 | Decide after the pilot |
| A central, opt-in scoreboard | Product brief | Decide after the pilot |
| AI-assisted advisory evaluation of evidence | Product brief | Decide after the pilot |
| External-write previews | Product brief | Build with the first curriculum region that needs them |

| Ideas that arrived mid-phase | `docs/PARKING-LOT.md` |
| What each version of the plan changed and learned | `docs/design/CHANGELOG.md` |

| Verify passes and audits | `docs/audits/` |

## 7.6 Known limitations of release one

Deliberate boundaries, stated for participants in `docs/RELEASE-NOTES.md`. The phase that
would lift each one is in brackets.

1. Recording a reviewer decision needs the local service or the CLI, because it writes files.
2. Reviewer identity is conventional, not cryptographic (ADR-030). [Phase 3, D11]
3. Environment Health shows build-time facts, not live ones. [Phase 7, D7]
4. Reviewer-awarded badges cannot yet be awarded; they show as pending. [Phase 3]
5. Validator isolation is policy plus process boundaries. [Phase 6, D9]
6. Catalog filtering needs JavaScript; region and tag pages work without it.
7. No coverage reporting, no glossary content type. [Phases 5 and 4, D2 and D1]
8. Binary and compressed files are not scanned for secrets. [Phase 6]
9. Clean-clone installation is tested in CI from a `git archive` export, not a real clone.
   [Phase 1 once by hand, Phase 5 on a schedule]
10. Earlier quest versions are not kept; pages show the current version's criteria.
    [Phase 3]
11. A validator grandchild that starts its own session outlives the timeout. [Phase 6]
12. Two builds are byte-identical only when `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` is set.

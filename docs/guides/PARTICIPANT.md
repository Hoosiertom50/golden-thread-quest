# Participant Guide

## What this is

A local application that presents a curriculum, helps you assemble credible evidence that
you did the work, and keeps a truthful record of what a reviewer has confirmed. Everything
it knows lives in ordinary files in your own repository. It reads them and writes a narrow
set of them; it does not own them.

## Getting started

**Pilot participants** follow [`PILOT.md`](PILOT.md) instead: one line sets everything up, and
`gtq start`, `gtq hand-in` and `gtq get-review` replace the commands below. The rest of this
guide, the states and what the application writes, applies to everyone.

Otherwise:

```bash
make setup
source .venv/bin/activate
make serve
```

`make serve` builds the site and starts a service bound to `127.0.0.1` only. It prints the
address to open. It does not print a token — the pages it serves carry one, substituted as
they are served, so it never reaches a file.

Without the service you can still read everything — the generated pages are ordinary HTML.
What you cannot do is change state, because nothing that changes a file happens in the
browser alone.

## The states, and who sets them

| State | Who put it there |
|---|---|
| Locked | The application, from your prerequisites |
| Available | The application |
| In progress | You |
| Evidence ready | You, asserting the proof is assembled |
| Locally validated | You, once the required checks have passed |
| Submitted for review | You |
| Needs changes | A reviewer |
| Verified | A reviewer |

Two totals are shown everywhere and never added together. **Claimed XP** is your own record.
**Verified XP** is only ever the result of a reviewer approving your evidence. Nothing you do
and nothing a validator returns can produce it.

## Doing a quest

1. **Read the whole quest page first.** Acceptance criteria are numbered, and a reviewer's
   findings will refer to them by number.
2. **Start it.** An evidence package appears under
   `participant/evidence/<quest>/<attempt>/` with a `PROOF.md` template, and your progress
   file is created if you did not have one.
3. **Do the work in your repository**, not in the application.
4. **Fill in `PROOF.md`.** It asks what you built, where the artifacts are, how to reproduce
   the behavior, what you validated and what remains. A reviewer should not have to hunt.
5. **Run the checks.** A failing check is never a failed quest — it tells you what to fix,
   and your work is untouched.
6. **Mark the evidence ready.**
7. **Record local validation.** This is a button. The state means "I have run the required
   checks and they qualify", and the application refuses it if the results do not support
   that. It comes *before* submitting, not after.
8. **Submit for review.** It is refused while any required file on the evidence page is
   missing or empty, and the refusal names each one.
9. **Hand in your work.** With the pilot setup, `gtq hand-in` commits `participant/`, pushes
   your branch and opens or updates your pull request. Without it, commit and push yourself:

   ```bash
   git switch -c evidence/<quest-id>
   git add participant/
   git commit -m "Evidence for <quest-id>"
   git push -u origin evidence/<quest-id>
   gh pr create --fill
   ```

   The application runs none of these. Pushing your evidence is a claim that the work is
   finished and ready for someone else's attention, and that claim is yours to make.

## Choosing a quest, and quests that write

The catalog lists 128 quests in nine regions; a quest is locked until its prerequisites are
verified. The Jira, GitHub and Trello regions need an account on that system. Nineteen of their
quests write to it, and each is marked as an external write: do those in a sandbox you are
allowed to change, never a production project, and follow the quest's preview, confirmation,
result-record and rerun requirements. If you have no sandbox, stop and ask. The application
itself never writes to an outside system. `docs/USER-GUIDE.md` has the longer version.

## What the application writes

Under `participant/`, only these, and only through documented actions:

- `participant/progress.yaml` — your state, written atomically and validated first
- `participant/evidence/**` — evidence packages, validation results, submission and review records
- `participant/ACTIVITY.md` — one line per change it made, for you to read

It also rewrites `generated/` on every action. That directory is machine-owned, gitignored
and disposable: `make build` recreates it from your content and your progress.

It never commits, pushes, merges or cleans. `make clean` removes generated output and
refuses to touch anything of yours.

## If something goes wrong

**An action is refused.** The page says so at the top, in red, with the reason. Nothing
changed, and the reason names what to fix.

**A check fails.** Read the findings; they are ordered with the most serious first and each
says what it observed and what to do. Your state does not change.

**A reviewer asks for changes.** Your evidence is preserved exactly as it was. Resume the
quest and address the findings.

**Your work looks lost.** It is in Git. `git status`, `git stash list`, `git reflog`.

**The application refuses to start.** Content that does not validate is never published, so
a broken curriculum stops the build rather than reaching you. `make validate-content` names
the file, field and fix.

"""Hand in quest work, and pick up a review, with one command each.

Participants are business analysts and manual testers, not developers (Phase 2A.1). The
0.2.0 hand-in was five Git steps and a pull request form, and picking up a review was a
`git pull` whose refusals are written for developers. `gtq hand-in` and `gtq get-review`
do the same steps and explain every refusal in plain words.

Pushing and opening a pull request claim, on the participant's behalf, that work is ready
(`review.submission_instructions`). So only these terminal commands do it, and only when
the participant runs them. The browser and the local service still never push, never open
a pull request and never merge. Hand-in stages `participant/` alone, so nothing outside
the participant's own folder is committed.

The repository layout is the one `install.sh` creates. `origin` is the participant's fork,
`upstream` is the program's repository, and the participant works on one branch that is
not `main`.

"""Secret detection patterns, shared by repository hygiene and evidence scanning.

This module is deliberately pure: it holds the patterns and a matcher, and knows nothing
about files, evidence packages or the repository. `tools/secret_scan.py` uses it to keep
secrets out of the repository; the evidence workspace uses it to keep secrets out of a
submission, and the validator runner uses it to redact captured output.

Detection here is a safety net, not a guarantee. A pattern list cannot recognize every
secret, so the surrounding policy — credentials come from the environment or an
authenticated CLI, never from content — is what actually protects the participant.

#
# Round 13 E11 dropped the leading `\b` from every fixed-prefix pattern so that a token
# glued directly to a preceding letter or digit (`nnnghp_…`, `xAKIA…`) would still match —
# `\b` requires a transition between a word and a non-word character, and every one of these
# prefixes starts with a letter, so nothing preceded it without one. Round 14 E1 found the
# other half of that trade was never checked: with no leading boundary at all and every
# pattern case-insensitive, `sk-[A-Za-z0-9_-]{20,}` matched the tail of "ta-SK-review-…" in
# an ordinary hyphenated slug, and `(?:sk|rk)_(?:live|test)_…` matched "network_TEST_…" in a
# log line — both real strings from evidence a participant is asked to submit (Trello card
# URLs, test names, branch names).
#
# The two constraints do not need the same answer for every prefix:
#
# * A **distinctive** prefix (`AKIA`/`ASIA`/…, `gh[pousr]_`, `glpat-`, `xox[abposr]-`,
#   `xapp-`, `AIza`, `sk-ant-`, `ATATT3`, `ATTA`, `github_pat_`, `ya29.`, `eyJ`) is long and
#   specific enough that it does not turn up inside ordinary words or identifiers, so it
#   keeps no leading boundary — the round 13 E11 cases stay caught.
# * A **short generic** prefix (`sk-`, `sk_`/`rk_live|test_`, `npm_`) is exactly the kind of
#   fragment that does turn up mid-word, so it requires `(?<![A-Za-z0-9])` before it *and*
#   at least one digit in the body — a real key of this shape has one; "review-onboarding-
#   checklist" and "test_connectivity" do not. A token of this kind glued to a preceding
#   letter is no longer detected; that trade is what this round makes.
#
# Every fixed-prefix pattern is also compiled case-sensitively now: a real prefix has a
# fixed case (`AKIA`, `sk-`, `ghp_`), so matching either case only bought false positives
# from ordinary uppercase text (`RISK-ASSESSMENT-…`). Keyword-driven patterns (an
# assignment, a bearer header, a URL scheme) stay case-insensitive, because the keyword
# itself — not a literal credential prefix — is what identifies them, and a keyword can
# legitimately appear in any case.

Every mutating action lives here rather than in the HTTP handler, so the same guards run
whichever way a participant reaches them. `quest_app.serve` calls this over HTTP for the
browser; `quest_app.cli action` calls it directly from a terminal, which is the only path
available on surfaces that cannot reach a loopback server — an agent sandbox, a remote
shell, CI.

The guards are the reason this is shared rather than reimplemented. A second copy of
"refuse to mark evidence ready if the secret scan finds something" is a second copy that
can drift, and the product's whole claim is that those rules cannot be gone around.

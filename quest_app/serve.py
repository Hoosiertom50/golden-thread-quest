"""The local action service.

It exists only to do the things a static page cannot safely do: record a state change, create
an evidence package, read Git status, run a registered validator, rebuild. Everything it is
*not* allowed to do is enforced here rather than assumed, because a localhost service is
still reachable by every program and every page on the machine.

The shape of the defense, in the order a request meets it:

1. **Loopback only.** A non-loopback bind address is refused at startup, not warned about.
2. **Same-origin.** `Origin` and `Referer`, when present, must match the address actually
   bound. A page on another site cannot post here from your browser.
3. **Per-run token.** Every state-changing request carries a token minted at startup and
   never written to disk. A page that has not been served by this run cannot have it.
4. **Strict body.** JSON only, with a hard size cap read before the body is.
5. **Allowlisted actions.** The caller names an action ID and a quest ID from the loaded
   content. No path and no command ever crosses the boundary.

`docs/SECURITY-AND-PRIVACY.md` is the source for all of it.

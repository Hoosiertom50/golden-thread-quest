"""Generate the site.

Two properties matter more than anything else here.

**Determinism.** Two builds from the same inputs must produce the same bytes, so a diff of
`generated/` means content changed and nothing else. Every traversal is sorted, every
mapping is written with sorted keys, and the one genuinely varying value — the build time —
is confined to the manifest and the footer, where it is labeled.

**Atomicity.** A failed build must leave the last good site intact. The whole site is
rendered into a sibling directory and swapped in at the end, so a participant reading a page
while a build fails keeps reading the page that was there.
